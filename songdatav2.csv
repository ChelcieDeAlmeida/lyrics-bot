Adele,All I Ask,"[Verse 1]  
I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Bridge]  
Let this be our lesson in love  
Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?

Adele,Can't Let Go,"[Verse 1]  
When did it go wrong, I will never know  
I have loved you all my life  
How did it slow down, I go round and round  
Thinking about it all the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
This love, it ain't over yet  
There's too much that I haven't said  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told  
Tell me was it all for the thrill?  
What was I thinking, I gave you everything  
But you still went for the kill  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Bridge]  
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark  
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat  
Do you even know that I can't let go  
  
[Outro]  
Hope you know, I won't let go

Adele,Crazy For You,"Found myself today singing out your name,  
You said I'm crazy,  
If I am I'm crazy for you.  
  
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
Turns me crazy,  
But it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible  
You drift into my head  
And turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
Tell me to run and I'll race,  
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,  
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
And make me crazy for you.  
Crazy for you.  
  
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.  
I wish you'd come over,  
Send me spinning closer to you.  
  
My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
But the more I do,  
The crazier I turn into.  
  
Pacing floors and opening doors,  
Hoping you'll walk through  
And save me boy,  
Because I'm too crazy for you.  
Crazy for you

Adele,Daydreamer,"Daydreamer  
Sitting on the sea  
Soaking up the sun  
He is a real lover  
And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl  
Like he's never felt a figure before  
  
A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back, oh  
  
You can find him sittin' on your doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And you can tell that he'll be there for life  
  
Daydreamer  
With eyes that make you melt  
He lends his coat for shelter  
Plus he's there for you  
When he shouldn't be  
But he stays all the same  
Waits for you  
Then sees you through  
  
There's no way I  
Could describe him  
What I'll say is  
Just what I'm hoping for  
  
But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

Adele,Hello,"[Verse 1]  
Hello, it's me  
I was wondering if after all these years  
You'd like to meet, to go over  
Everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  
  
Hello, can you hear me?  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
There's such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
It's no secret  
That the both of us are running out of time  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Anymore

Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home

At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart

Adele,I Miss You,"[Verse 1]  
I want every single piece of you  
I want your heaven and your oceans too  
Treat me soft but touch me cruel  
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby  
Bring the floor up to my knees  
Let me fall into your gravity  
Then kiss me back to life to see  
Your body standing over me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Verse 2]  
I love the way your body moves  
Towards me from across the room  
Brushing past my every groove  
No one has me like you do  
Baby, bring your heart, I'll bring my soul  
But be delicate with my ego  
I wanna step into your great unknown  
With you and me setting the tone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Bridge]  
We play so dirty in the dark  
Cause we are living worlds apart  
It only makes it harder, baby  
It only makes it harder, baby  
Harder baby, harder baby

I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light

Adele,Melt My Heart To Stone,"Right under my feet there's air made of bricks  
Pulls me down turns me weak for you  
I find myself repeating like a broken tune  
And I'm forever excusing your intentions  
That I give in to my pretendings  
Which forgive you each time  
Without me knowing  
They melt my heart to stone  
  
[Chorus]  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Each and every time I turn around to leave  
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  
So desperately I try to link it with my head  
But instead I fall back to my knees  
As you tear your way right through me  
I forgive you once again  
Without me knowing  
You've burnt my heart to stone  
  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Why do you steal my hand  
Whenever I'm standing my own ground  
You build me up, then leave me dead  
  
I hear your words you made up  
I say your name like there should be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love  
I'm the only one in love

Adele,Need You Know,"Picture perfect memories,  
Scattered all around the floor.  
Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it anymore.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.  
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk,  
And I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
I just need you now.  
Oh baby I need you now.

Adele,Now And Then,"Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad  
It cuts through the deepest parts of me  
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry  
How I'm still trying to stay inside  
Hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Every now and then my memories ache  
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made  
But as time goes on and my age gets older  
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain  
'Cause heart break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal

Adele,Someone Like You,"I heard, that you're settled down  
That you found a girl and you're, married now  
  
I heard, that your dreams came true  
I guess she gave you things  
I didn't give to you  
  
Old friend, why are you so shy  
Ain't like you to hold back  
Or hide from the light  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I had hoped you'd see my face  
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best  
For you too, don't forget me  
I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised  
In a summer haze bound by the surprise  
Of our glory days  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I hoped you'd see my face

Regrets and mistakes their memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet  
This would taste  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say

Remember your brothers and sisters

Backstreet Boys,Anywhere For You,"I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
  
I'd walk halfway around the world  
For just one kiss from you  
Far beyond the call of love  
The sun, the stars, the moon  
As long as your love's there to lead me  
I won't lose my way believe me  
Even through the darkest night you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Your love as far as I can see  
Is all I'm ever gonna need  
There's one thing for sure  
I know it's true  
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you  
  
I used to think that dreams were just  
For sentimental fools  
And I'd never find someone  
Who'd give their love so true  
But I knew the very minute  
Couldn't live my life without you in it  
And now I want the whole world  
To know

Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oh [Repeat: x3]

Backstreet Boys,Betcha By Golly Wow!,"There's a spark of magic in your eyes  
And Candyland appears each time you smile

But they come true, when I'm near you  
Your a genie in disguise  
Full of wonder and surprise  
  
And, Betcha by golly Wow!  
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever  
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong

Ladies, sometimes a man can't find the words  
To express all he feels inside  
But ever just so often  
The words of another, who's truly in love  
Seem to work our just fine  
  
To say I love you  
To say.....  
I love you  
  
Keep growing strong

Backstreet Boys,Cinderella,"As I was walking down a  
Path in the woods one day I  
Came across a vision that caught my eye  
  
There was a lady standing  
Right there beside a well, and I heard her whisper  
What you wish for you can have  
  
Then the vision went away  
I thought that I had lost her  
The girl I had been waiting for  
I can't believe I just saw her  
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine  
Now I want her next to me, cause I want, cause I want more  
Whoahhhh  
  
Chorus  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
  
She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and  
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain  
The first thing I see each morning, the last thing I see at night  
You know if I could have all that  
That's all I wish for in my life  
  
Why did she have to go  
What do I say to find her  
This girl is the only one  
I cannot deny her  
She's making love to my mind  
And I can't forget this feeling  
It's her voice that's calling  
It's her voice I need  
Whoahhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
You're all that I want  
You're all that I need  
Come back to me now

Girl, can't you see that you're my only vice  
  
Turn the whole world off  
Keep your high heels on  
Take it nice and slow  
And make it last 'til dawn  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I don't wanna eat, I don't wanna sleep  
Don't wanna sit around and watch TV  
When you're next to me it's where I wanna be  
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I, I wanna do  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to, but  
All I wanna do is you

Bon Jovi,All I Want Is Everything,"Some fifteen year old kid sits on his porch  
Just half-past noon, trying to figure out just what he's doing  
Why he had to grow up so soon  
With all the gangs, all the guns, watcha gonna learn in school?  
There's got to be some way out of here  
He says, ""Man, this life is cruel""  
I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life  
She changed her name, her face  
Because the grass looked greener on the other side  
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night  
Her friends, her family feel the pain but she's the one who cries  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr., I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything  
My next door neighbor Donnie  
Died in his room just the other day  
His brother come home  
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein  
Cops come down with a body bag  
They said Donnie was a casualty  
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out  
He couldn't handle reality  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr. I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything

Bon Jovi,"All Talk, No Action","First time I saw you girl,  
I knew that it wouldn't be long  
I tried holding back my feelings  
But you came on so strong  
No one told me about her  
But I know they all knew  
That I know all about the girls  
That do the things you do  
  
Cause you're all talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
  
You're playing those games with me baby,  
But one of us has got to win  
Someday all the boys are gonna find out  
That you won't even play it with them  
You're running out of numbers baby  
You won't say no, you just say maybe  
One of these days you're gonna get  
What's coming to you  
  
Cause you're all talk, no action  
All talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
You better stop this fooling around  
You're all talk no action  
You turn it up to cool me down, cool me down, cool me down  
  
Sticks and stones will break my bones  
But their names could never hurt me  
Cause I ain't afraid of you running away  
If you love me tonight then desert me  
  
Cause you're all talk, and no action  
You're all talk, but no action  
You're all talk, but no action  
You're all talk

Bon Jovi,Always,"This Romeo is bleeding, but you can't see his blood  
It's nothing but some feelings  
That this old dog kicked up  
It's been raining since you left me  
Now I'm drowning in the flood  
You see I've always been a fighter  
But without you I give up  
  
Now I can't sing a love song  
Like the way it's meant to be  
Well,I guess I'm not that good anymore  
But baby, that's just me  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always  
  
Now we're picture's that you left behind  
Are just memories of a different life  
Some that made us laugh  
Some that made us cry  
One that made you have to say goodbye  
  
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair  
Touch your lips, to hold you near,  
When you say your prayers, try to understand  
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man  
  
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near  
When he says the words  
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him  
'Cause these words are mine, to say to you  
'Til the end of time  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
If you told me to cry for you, I could  
If you told me to die for you, I would  
Take a look at my face  
There's no price I won't pay  
To say these words to you  
  
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice  
But baby, if you give me just one more try  
We can pack up our old dreams, and our old lives,  
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always

I been looking for something to please me since I don't know when  
Out on the dark side of town  
Another rumbles gone down  
And life on the high side isn't what this boys about  
  
She's got something I want man, it's something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me

I stand accused  
I can always run to you

And a soul of steel  
We've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal  
And when I give her the gun  
You know she feels so right  
And we don't let go when we're alone when I'm holding her so tight.

Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you  
  
Sometimes I wish I could just let go  
But I love you (I love you)  
And I believe that one day you will come around  
But can you tell me  
  
How do I always end up being the girl at the window

You say you'll be home but you never make it  
So why do I...  
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)

I know you're working that's why you're leaving  
I will never argue your reasons

When she was just a girl she expected the world  
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth  
Life goes on, it gets so heavy  
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall  
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes  
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

Somebody ran away saying, ""Fast as I can""

Once upon a time we fell apart  
You're holding in your hands  
The two halves of my heart  
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
  
Once upon a time we're burning bright  
That all we ever seemed to do is fight  
On and on  
And on and on and on  
  
Once upon a time on the same side  
Once upon a time on the same side  
In the same game, now why'd you have to go  
Have to go and throw it all in my flame  
  
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king  
Could have had a castle and worn a ring  
But no, you let me go

Drake,Karaoke,"Things have been so crazy and hectic, I should have got her back by now  
But you know how much I wanted to make it, It's probably better anyhow  
So if you gotta go, if there's anything I should know  
If the spotlight makes you nervous  
If you're looking for a purpose  
You put the tea in the kettle and light it  
Put your hand on the metal and feel it  
But do you even feel it anymore?  
I remember when you thought I was joking  
Now I'm off singing karaoke  
Farther than I've ever been  
So if you gotta go, if there's any way I can help  
  
Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner?  
And tells me that my life is too much and moves to Atlanta? Damn  
Of all the places you could go  
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know  
I'm always up too late, I worry about you there alone  
And that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron  
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy  
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories about his lady  
I know they say the first love is the sweetest  
But that first cut is the deepest  
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets  
You were telling everybody but me  
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky  
I'm surprised you couldn't tell  
  
I was only trying to get ahead  
I was only trying to get ahead  
But the spotlight makes you nervous  
And you're looking for a purpose  
I was only trying to get ahead

Drake,Light Up,"I've been up for four days  
Getting money both ways  
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades  
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades  
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age  
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you  
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true  
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying  
I'm just here making all the music that they party to  
But party on, party on, all night nigga  
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga  
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars  
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire  
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth  
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot  
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park  
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose  
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target  
But a target nonetheless and I just started  
Was that directed at moi? Can't be  
They must be talking to themselves hoe, hands free  
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner  
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner  
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music  
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar  
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you  
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,  
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you  
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit' you  
Don't get impatient when it takes too long  
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong  
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me  
Promise to always give you me, the real me  
  
Who would have thought  
I'd be caught in this life?  
Let's celebrate with a toast  
And get lost in tonight  
And make it all light up

Wait until the sun goes down  
We gon' make this bitch light up  
Even when the sun goes down  
I'm gon' make this go  
  
Ow, hoes turn they heads like, owls  
I'm the man of the hour  
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how  
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power  
Bright life'd make your whole city light up  
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub  
I just landed in that G450  
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy  
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk  
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk  
I don't do too much blogging  
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'

'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched

Will silly raps feuds tryin' to distract you  
In disguise, in the form of a favor  
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors

That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off  
The summer's ours, the winter too  
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do  
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7  
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you  
And since no good deed go unpunished  
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was  
I once was, cool as The Fonz was  
But these bright lights turned me to a monster  
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me  
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me  
Fuck niggas, bitches too  
All I got is this money, this'll do

Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast

Only you can do it just like that  
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower  
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad  
Sound so smart like you graduated college  
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard  
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool  
Couple things due but you always get it done  
Might have been a time when I loved her too  
But you take that away and you'll always be the one  
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl  
Maybe it's just right for the night  
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl  
They want you in their life as a wife  
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest  
Why you want to fight for your right  
'Cause you don't love them boys  
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise  
  
[Chorus]  
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go  
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?  
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine  
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time  
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you  
  
B-b-b-b-bet I am  
All of them bitches I'm badder than  
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon  
But I never mention everything I dabble in  
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'  
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat  
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too  
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high  
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch  
  
But baby, if you ask me to take a break  
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say  
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away  
  
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'  
I'm a star, sheriff badge  
What's the point if I'm guarding?

Start to think I got to get it how I live  
We too busy for a wedding or a kid  
If I'm working then I know you working  
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous

Drake,Preach,"[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]  
I'm in Miami  
I need to call up Miss Cassidy  
My name is party not participation  
Sorry for the miscommunication  
I need a drink and some tequila with you  
You know what I'm trying to do  
Hey let's pop the E off at Liv I've got some time here to blow  
I've got the money to blow  
I've got the money and blow  
Don't have to guess how I know  
Oh it's a secret just for me I'll keep it  
You old niggas boring as bones  
Put the party tape on  
You know what's going on  
You know what's going on  
She keep it wet like tsunami  
She think she sunk the Titanic  
I get her hot like Wasabi  
She think it's wavy and gnarly

Drink one for you

[Verse 2: Drake]  
Still in Miami  
Most of these girls are too messy  
I've got to do some reflecting  
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction  
I'm convinced that my calls are being recorded  
So hit my assistant to get me the message  
And make the connection like brrrrr  
I'm on my way tonight I hope you not the crazy type yeah  
I'm in your state tonight I might just break the bank tonight  
PND ain't with the ray tay tay  
You know Jay Ray  
Got girls her going way way way way way way  
Sauga city trip the pay day  
Load up off a gate way  
Man you can't afford me  
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story  
Niggas is all in their feelings these days, all in their feelings these days  
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid

Drake,Replacement Girl,"(feat. Trey Songz)  
  
[Echo-Trey Songz]  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement  
  
[Verse 1-Drake]  
Lat me show what it is  
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map  
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap  
If you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like  
[Trey]  
Ooo wee  
[Drake]  
Took 'em from white snakes to  
[Trey]  
Ooo wee  
[Drake]  
This metaphore might sound a little confusing but  
[Trey]  
Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah  
[Drake]  
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in  
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at
amazing'  
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us  
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is  
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious  
What you really expect when I strut through town  
Two or three days I shut you down  
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz  
You call him the prince he rep two up two down  
Anyone I know get used to me  
I'm far from the man that I used to be  
I don't ever really kick game  
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me  
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that  
Need good lovin' I'm providing that  
Understand that I'm worldwide  
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at  
'Cause I do things from the M-town  
To the uk  
From Spain back out to Texas  
This album's for my fans  
But yo this hook is for my exes  
  
[Chorus-Trey Songz]  
This one is for you girl  
You know who you are girl  
You only show you're face  
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl  
What you trying to to make it  
Don't ever mistake it  
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you  
You had a chance now It's gone  
Oooooh  
You had a man now you don't  
Back to the basics  
I think I made it  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl  
  
[Verse 2-Trey Songz]  
Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly  
Lookin for someone your type  
I done left behind the love of my life  
Tryin to find another one tonight  
And if it's you baby  
Let yourself be seen  
Don matter skirts  
Dresses or jeans  
I got that work  
Know what I mean  
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3-Drake]  
Check this out  
From the that she get picked for some take out  
Until they slip up and break out  
But it's another story over here at Drake's house  
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out  
And I'm lean back  
Scoping  
Looking for a woman that I should wife  
Who got just the right amount of loyalty  
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life  
We go la, va  
Ny, to  
Sunshine in that heat stroke  
And them fur hoods in that deep snow  
We have breakfast in the bedroom  
Break bread downstairs in the basement  
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more  
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay

And there's things you gotta go through  
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do  
And they never will  
  
[Verse 1]  
But I swear you gotta chill  
You wanna grip Benz wheel  
And I know you can't wait  
You dream big and sleep late  
You got a lot on your plate  
That's why you're always working out  
Taking pictures of yourself  
You don't see anybody else  
You're like oh well  
You're like fuck it oh well

Ok I know you want the Audi  
I know you want to go to Maui  
You and all your girlfriends  
The ones you never bring around me  
Cause you don't trust me like your last man  
Did he open doors for ya?  
Buy the things he can't afford for ya  
Cause he must have did a lot for ya  
I just fell back with it  
And now your past is behind you  
Like the car with the strap in it  
Thank god that's finished  
Cause now it's back to business  
Any more henny and you're past the limit  
You told me about the picture  
Now you have to send it  
I would never put you on blast when I get it

You're my right hand, you're my go to

Drake,Runaway Girl,"Hey there material girl  
The neighbors told me that you're moving out  
Leaving to witness the world  
But are you sure that's what you're doing now  
  
Are you running away for a purpose  
Do you even know what your self worth is  
The past what you carry in your purses  
The gift in the curse when you going head first is  
The atl, mia, lax, jfk  
Luggage all packed and to them I say  
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you've lost  
You're waking up every day  
The run away, run away girl  
I turn and your gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
The run away, the run away girl  
  
So long  
Farewell  
Good bye  
Good day  
Be on  
Your way  
Run away girl

Watching it all through the window  
And wishing you could make is shatter now  
Now that you're here on the other side  
Are you sure it even matters  
  
Are you living the dream  
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems  
Do you strip do you model do you live in between  
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you lost  
You're waking up every day  
To run away, run away girl  
I turn and you're gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
You run away, run away girl  
  
So long

Drake,Say What's Real,"Why do I feel so alone?  
Like everybody passing through the studio  
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role  
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know  
And I don't have the heart to give these  
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go  
So they stick around kicking out feedback  
And I entertain it as if I need that  
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that  
My privacy about the only thing I need back but  
It's hard to think of them polite flows  
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes  
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes  
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed  
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows  
Life was so full  
Now this shit just being lipo'd  
Always said I'd say it all on the right track  
But in this game you only lose when you fight back  
Black diamond bracelets  
Showing you the basics  
I can't live and hold the camara  
Someone gotta tape this  
I make hits unlike a bitch  
That's married I ain't miss  
24 hours from greatness  
I'm that close  
Don't ever forget the moment  
You began to doubt  
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South  
Watchin' whole show  
Embarrassed to pull my camera out  
And my mother embarrassed  
To pull my Phantom out  
So I park about 5 houses down  
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown  
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around  
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus  
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness  
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus  
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless  
And promoters try to get me out to they club  
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how  
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl  
Standing with my next girl  
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now  
And shit could get weird unless they all down  
And so I stay clear  
  
We from a small town  
Everybody talks and everybody listen  
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing  
I've always been something that these labels can't buy  
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my soul  
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez ""Damn Drake fly""  
And he just be like ""Silly mother fucker I know""  
That was your bad  
How could you pass up on 'em?  
He just take them records  
And he gas up on 'em  
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em  
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em  
Oh they did Po  
At least they tried to  
And that's what happens  
When you spitting what's inside you  
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video  
And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And don't listen to anybody that knew me  
'Cause to have known me would  
Mean that there's a new me  
And if you think I changed in the slightest  
Could of fooled me  
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3  
Drug dealers live vicariously through me  
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy  
I'm just not the social type  
And campus life is crazy understand  
I could get money with my eyes closed  
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo  
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll  
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know  
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will  
I got new shit  
I'm gettin' better still  
Little niggas put my name in they verses  
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal  
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill  
And I think this got this ""Making of a Legend"" feel  
Problem with these other niggas they  
Ain't never real  
Yea that's all I can say

You showed me that we can't be

Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me  
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted  
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
6 point star, Lion of the Judah  
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci  
One do it then we all gotta do it  
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it  
Whole city at your head for the boy  
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Drake,Stunt Hard,"[Chorus]  
I did it all on my own,  
Turned a chair to a throne,  
I'm a king in this world,  
(Stunt hard)  
I put my whole city on,  
To some things that they never would've known,  
If I didn't,  
(Stunt hard)  
And every night is a premiere,  
If I ever disappear,  
Best believe I'm comin' back.  
(Stunt hard)  
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,  
On that same shit again,  
All I ever do is,  
(Stunt hard)  
  
(Drake):  
I tell her.  
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.  
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.  
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who Is He"",  
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.  
And I'm focused on my survival.  
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.  
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols.  
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.  
I'm everything you just haven't become.  
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.  
Now hopefully let them see,  
What they say that I'm gon' be,  
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.  
Get your team in order, assembly is key.  
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.  
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,  
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.  
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.  
But I'm just trying to swerve.  
Without hitting the curb.  
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.  
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.  
I am not them. I Photoshop them, out.  
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.  
Yeah.  
The Chris Paul  
Of this fall,  
Sittin' this tall.  
I float high,  
Goodbye,  
I will miss y'all.

If I don't do nothin', Imma stunt my ass off.  
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.  
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.  
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.  
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stunt devil.  
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.  
I'm a young rebel.  
And I got a baby face.  
I need a young pebbles.  
I need a stuntdouble.

I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.  
Yeah!  
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes

I'm on the cup of that tilt.  
And if you hatin' on me  
I'll say fuck you like wilt.  
Yeah!  
I'm a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.  
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace.

Talkin' big big shit.  
I am rude,

And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.  
I hustle harder.  
I live in the Carter.

All I see is tomorrow.

Better feed me.

Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur.

Ask her,  
Am I their man,  
Her answer,

Drake,Take Care,"Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
I've asked about you and they've told me things  
But my mind didn't change  
I still the feel the same  
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know  
We know, they don't get you like I will  
My only wish is I die real  
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal  
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still  
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case  
Big girls all get a little taste  
Pushing me away so I give her space  
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break  
I'll be there for you, I will care for you  
I keep thanking you, just don't know  
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that  
On your face girl, it just don't show  
When you're ready, just say you're ready  
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy  
And the parties over, just don't forget me  
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow  
You won't ever have to worry,  
You won't ever have to hide  
And you seen all my mistakes  
So look me in my eyes  
  
Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
It's my birthday, I get high if I want to  
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to  
Cause you don't say you love me  
To your friends when they ask you  
Even though we both know that you do (you do)  
One time, been in love one time  
You and all your girls in the club one time  
All so convinced that you're following your heart  
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes  
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know  
We know,  
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one  
You hate the fact that you bought the dream  
And they sold you one  
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you  
Instead they say  
  
Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost

Drake,The Language,"I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring  
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement  
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction  
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum  
I am the kid with the motor mouth  
I am the one that you should worry about  
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?  
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around  
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down  
I don't waste time putting money down  
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash  
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first
class  
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city  
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever  
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it  
  
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell  
I will never understand that but oh well  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited  
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited  
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence  
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do  
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through  
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple  
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me  
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to
me  
Hate when they get too attached to me  
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road  
Get what I can out the country and then I just get on the jet and go back to
the cold  
Can't even drive with the top off  
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer  
I just might bring in some girls from Miami  
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it

Drake,The Resistance,"Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.  
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.  
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye,  
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.  
You can stay but shawty here I go  
  
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?  
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.  
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.  
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.  
I am, still here with who I started with.  
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.  
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.  
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.  
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.  
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.  
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a florist,  
And that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous.  
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.  
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.  
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.  
I'm trying to do better than good enough.  
  
[Chorus]  
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.  
But people I don't have the time to hang with,  
Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)  
You promised me you would never change.  
You promised me you would never change.  
  
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.  
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.  
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.  
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.  
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.  
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.  
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,  
That I barley know at all and,  
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected  
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.  
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.  
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,  
I'm holding on by a thread it's,  
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,  
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.  
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,  
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.  
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.  
Which made me question when I went missing.  
And when I start treating my friends different.  
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.  
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.  
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.  
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.  
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.  
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.  
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.  
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.  
Did I just trade free time for camera time?  
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?  
I just need some closure.  
Ain't no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.

Eminem,Farewell,"I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Farewell miss I know that you can care less  
But I'm sorry for everything I was careless  
But I need you to know that I love you so much  
And I've been drinking myself to sleep my soul's crushed  
A couple more shots I know I'm gonna go nuts  
I can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch  
I was in love with you how could you do this to me  
Actually I did this to myself, what a tragedy!  
And now what do I do?  
Where do I go?  
Cause everywhere I go I see your face  
It's hard starting over  
Trying to find another shoulder  
To lean on  
I feel like my whole life just got peed on  
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain  
As crazy as it sounds to me it's sane  
And I like it, why? 'cause I feel like we're still united  
In some weird way I don't wanna fight it  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
I wrote you the other day and you didn't write back!  
It's like that!? after all the crap we been through!?  
I can't believe you! I know I fucked up!  
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!  
You keep sending me to voicemail!  
I'm annoyed, hell!, shit you coulda at least sent a text  
But you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips  
While I'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!  
You're hard headed a sharp headache  
I need help call a medic  
I just cut myself, yeah, I did it  
Without you I'm nothing don't you get it!?  
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it!  
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that  
We ever met, I can't believe you just said that  
You're so cold you just hit me so low  
I can't take this no more, so hit the road  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Some things just don't seem the way they do  
One day you tell me I love you and only you  
I wake up to find out it was a dream  
You're telling me you hate me, you're leaving me  
People change everything changes  
We go from best friends then become strangers  
We go from seeing each other everyday then  
Farewell to never seeing your face again  
  
I can't get you outta of my head  
So I'm out of bed at 4 in the morning  
Wishing I was dead  
But for some odd reason I can't do it  
For some reason I needed to write  
What's on my mind and what's going through it  
Cause if I don't I'll probably suffocate  
Why do you have so much hate  
Towards me you need some loving babe  
God I fucking love you I hate myself  
For falling in love with you  
Just to find out all I did was trouble you  
My heart is aching I'm medicated  
I tried meditating  
But nothing works I don't even feel sedated  
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second  
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked  
Fuck humiliation, you do anything to get me back  
Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact  
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good  
And do everything to have me if you could  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight

And looking at you, ur probably hung like a baby.  
I pissed you off with that one liner  
But I'm sure ill do it again like a big tymer.  
Ok right now I'm gonna let you flow  
And when I'm tired of hearin your shit ill let you know.  
  
Its my turn and I'm gonna drop a bomb  
Blow you up like a fucking Vietcong.  
I'm sick with the rhymes I've just said  
Don't mind my face its a little red.  
Cuz I'm embarrassed to be up here its true  
Its not cuz I'm scared its cuz I'm battling someone like you.  
I mean jesus your rhymes aint even witty  
And every one here knows your lyrics are shitty  
But its ok cuz your tryin your best  
And if you have a girlfriend I'm sure her backs like her chest  
In other words you be fucking a guy  
And don't tell me the excuse, its cuz I was high  
Its cuz your like at the other fags who think their cool  
But infact your really enjoy pushing it stool!  
  
I'm done ok I can't think of any thing else to say  
I'm at lost for words cuz my rhymes might be soundin gay  
But then again we listened to your rhymes so I guess it would be ok.  
Ill finish your off with a one liner and then I'm done.  
This is the rhyme that with solididfy that I won.  
I listened to every rhyme youve said  
And it was all mumble jumble like your were giving some head.  
Now remember I'm white so I don't belong in the rap game  
But id be there before you cuz your lyrics where fuck in lame!!!

You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)  
X2  
  
[Verse]  
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best  
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it  
From the fact that I'm comin' back  
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that  
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap  
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques  
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long  
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise  
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died  
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there  
Damn I forgot how much money he got  
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay  
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot  
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned  
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25  
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still  
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit  
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick  
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score  
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store  
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us  
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers  
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay  
I'm just a super easy modest mc, okay?  
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'  
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then  
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards

Eminem,If I Had...,"Life  
By Marshal Mathers  
What is life?  
Life is like a big obstacle  
In front of your optical to slow you down  
  
And every time you think you gotten past it  
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground  
What are friends?  
Friends are people that you think are your friends  
But they really your enemies, with secret identities  
And disguises, to hide they true colors  
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'  
  
What is money?  
Money is what makes a man act funny  
Money is the root of all evil  
Money'll make them same friends come back around  
Swearing that they was always down  
  
What is life?  
I'm tired of life  
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins  
I'm tired of committing so many sins  
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins  
Tired of never having any ends  
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things  
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins  
Tired of not having a deal  
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel  
Tired of drowning in my sorrow  
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo  
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off  
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour  
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off  
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough  
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk  
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk  
I'm tired of using plastic silverware  
Tired of working in Building Square  
Tired of not being a millionaire  
But if I had a million dollars  
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics  
  
If I had a magic wand,  
I'd make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on,  
While I'm on the john  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldn't be enough,  
Because I'd still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
  
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor  
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store  
I'm tired of not having a phone  
Tired of not having a home  
To have one in if I did have it on  
Tired of not driving a B-M  
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him  
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M  
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum  
Tired of not being on tour  
Tired of fucking the same blond whore  
After work in the back of a Contour  
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones  
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns  
  
Tired of being stared at  
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat  
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz  
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs  
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me  
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me  
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs  
Tired of J-L-be saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives""  
  
But if I had a million dollars  
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics  
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john  
  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
You know what I'm saying?  
I'm tired of all of this bullshit  
Telling me to be positive  
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
I rap about shit around me, shit I see  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
Right now I'm tired of everything  
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city

But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?  
Just fed up

Well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic  
They compelled me  
To kill this elderly man  
  
And I get these panic attacks  
Pop a xanax, relax  
Try to stick my fucking dick  
Inside a mannequins ass  
  
Then I get manic depressed  
And the orthodontist get gas masked  
Kick ass  
The first thing I'll put on is the mask  
  
Speaking of masks, man  
It ain't to late to have a change of pace  
And take it off and show my face  
So you can see the things you face  
And slice you up  
And cook you after your murder  
By strangulation  
  
that's bacon souffle  
You making ain't you  
Well thank you jason  
  
There goes one more coma  
Due to blunt force trauma  
Just give me one more soma

Go in the damn broom closet  
Another valium lost it  
Shovin the vacuums nozzle  
Down the bathroom faucet

The medication is making my hands a little shakier  
Hand me that 18 month old baby  
To shake him up  
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea  
Breaking his neck in 80 some places

Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms

Twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects  
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up  
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog  
This is the season for noise pollution contamination  
Examination of more cartoons than animation  
My lamination of narration  
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation  
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing  
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense  
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse  
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans  
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans  
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal  
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people  
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium  
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one  
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator  
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus  
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases  
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces  
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis  
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally  
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments  
Now I'm trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it  
I'm infinite  
  
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since  
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O  
So I'm assuming all responsibility  
'Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's  
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler  
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler  
No one is specialer, My skill is intergalactical  
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school  
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical  
I'd rather let a tactical, tact full track tickle your fancy  
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine  
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching  
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam  
Plus the man who never had a plan B  
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit  
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit  
I'm infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments  
Now I'm trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it.  
I'm infinite  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments  
Now I'm trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it.

Into some bullshit  
Sooner or later

Are too jealous of us to love us  
You hate it,  
G-unit made it,  
Then Obie's coming,  
D-twizzy's comin, ya sick to  
Ya stomach  
50 percent of it's 50 Cent,  
The other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is  
But if you even considerin' takin' our label down,  
You better find our building  
And fly a fuckin plane into it  
But I ain't tryin to get to intricate into it,  
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit  
'cause then it's gonna get to the point  
Where it escalates into some other shit,  
Then I'm a flip  
Then I'm a get to  
Stompin' in my Air Force once,  
Won't be able to tell if its two purrs or it's one

You think Nike just made these cleats into shoes  
I don't know what it is or what it could be,  
But I get a woody,  
When these pussies try to push me  
Thinkin they gone put me in a position to pickle me  
Y'all tickle me pink,  
I think I'd just rather have pink tickle me  
Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety,  
A little bit of the diggety doc  
Diggety mixed with a little bit of the jigga j-jigga  
What a small pinch,  
Biggy look at me,  
I'm just a bomb diggety

Pajama time  
Come here little kiddies, on my lap  
Guess who's back with a brand new rap  
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case  
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah  
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys  
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything,  
But little boys  
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor,  
I'm just psycho  
I go a little bit crazy sometimes  
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes  
Good God, dip, do a little slide  
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor  
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go  
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it  
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK  
Oops my C-D just skipped  
And everyone just heard you let one rip,

It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party  
All the way to Sunday, maybe till Monday, I dunno what day  
Everyday's just a holiday  
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy  
Get the top down, let my hair blow,  
I dunno where I'm goin'  
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body  
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk  
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work  
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair  
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah  
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?  
Man, you must be up out your mind  
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up,  
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened  
They say I was running butt naked  
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah  
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember  
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty  
They said save it boy, we got you on tape  
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body""  
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down  
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound  
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now  
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves  
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?  
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba  
I don't have any lines to go right here so  
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?  
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?  
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls, tall girls, small girls,

Butt squeezing it's the season

Welcome to the slim shady mecca Rebbecca  
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca  
It's my sector homosexual dissector  
Come again rewind selector  
I said nice rectum  
I had a vasectomy Hector  
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya  
Hannibal Lector in the guy sex and I bet ya  
I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya  
They said once bitten n twice shy  
We lie next to the guy  
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra  
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir  
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser  
It's my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester  
Drop, kick the bits before a second trimester  
Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser  
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her

So you better change the station  
To keep from throwin' up  
Man you seen it all before your alter a million with it  
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it  
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't  
I won right by the Pussy Cat Dolls ""When call you kitten""  
I'll pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna  
Spray perfume in the sauna room  
Crazy glue in Madonna to  
The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her  
Imagine if visual for that man  
Who woulda thought  
Could ever be such a relentless prick  
And leashin' his fingers  
For the chicks who waltz  
She looks like she outlived her life sentence  
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive  
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be  
Your so sensitive

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand  
Kick it up and push him and knee him right into quick sand

With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man  
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many

Hey,  
Yeah,  
  
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable  
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs Huckstable  
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like lunchables  
Like white boys in grade school  
We ate school made food just  
Eyeing they sh-t, wish I was trying they sh-t  
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn't buying that sh-t  
No I aint crying a bit man  
That's just life that's just how shit work  
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt  
Gotta learn when you get hurt  
Even if it's with cupid  
He beat you and you went back  
Who's officially stupid  
Oh yeah I understand that's your man,  
You had a plan  
You been together for some years  
You sticking with him for the kids  
So you overlook the tears but we both know that's a bad look  
Cause 20 years from now your daughter will probably get her ass whooped  
If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use  
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce  
Cole, cole, cole  
  
If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use  
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce  
It's Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move  
A I'll ass n-gga who just so happened to stay in school  
Still rap for hustlers and muthaf-ckers that hated school  
Said that's for busters that heard my sh-t and I made it cool  
This aint to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping  
I got gangsta n-ggas that lining up in that missions office  
And possibly cause all the hoe n-ggas scrape  
And I sh-t up on my plate so you know a n-gga late to my first class  
I'd much rather sit up in first class  
Should I admit that a slutty b-tch was my first smash  
Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out  
Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about  
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout  
I used to ask for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind  
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind  
Was just a young boy staring out my blind  
Till I got free from my momma leash  
Running loose through the streets  
Like a stray dog in heat  
And we looking for some freaks can you play  
Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame  
No not me  
She do hours on the team cause she seen how tall I'd be  
In the club dappin' n-ggas, even til he are-I-P  
Damn, you win some, you lose some  
That just how it's happens  
And if a n-gga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em  
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom  
It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping  
Cause see some n-ggas was haters that I viewed as clowns  
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around  
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now  
If they don't know your dreams, than they can't shoot em down

Tell them people I aint home  
Half black learning white lies  
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys  
Too ashamed to bring around cause her homegirls'll clown like  
""Girl I aint know you like 'em bitesize""  
She embarrassed now  
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now  
They probably think I'm no good for 'em  
Too dark, too thick, too hood for 'em  
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I'm doing here  
They got me feeling like a job interview in here  
They asking questions about a 5 year plan  
She saying ""who I'm foolin', they could never understand""  
They could never understand

Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time

The singles only the look to sell these niggas the book  
I can only pray that one day you'll read into it  
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems  
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums  
I zone out, that old sound that I've grown out of  
Was born out of being broke with hope  
But it don't matter I'm on Saturn now and I won't shatter  
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I'm gonna gather my thoughts  
As sharp as a bow and arrow  
Back when I had no dough and no apparrel  
My flow's thorough, now I'm more aware of the? A nigga face  
Loaded pistols with nickle plates, the nigga fake  
That's why I call the shit a race  
Tha gony of defeat, w ish the elite could get a taste

The worst part about growing up man the shit just aint for free  
Maybe I can be someone people pay to see  
And maybe I should move up outta here to the place to be

What's love got to do, go to do with it  
I get a little taste then I'm through with it  
Then I send it right back to you with it  
  
[Verse 1: J. Cole]  
Visionary play your position, no missionary  
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke  
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope  
Now picture that  
My poetry's deep now fish for that  
Only real n-ggas catch something, phoney n-ggas fail  
Sh-t you gotta feel like it's only read in braille  
Both did the crime but his homie didn't tell  
So he f-cking b-tches while he sitting lonely in a cell  
Thinking well, what the hell I been on  
They gave a n-gga five then they threw another ten on  
By the time I'm back on the streets like a bachelor  
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman  
Life is a movie, pick your own role  
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole  
Sit around crying that's like sitting round dying  
You wanna touch the sky b-tch you figure out flying  
  
[Chorus:]  
N-gga how high, so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' b-tch  
N-gga please, my squad stack plenty of G's  
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees  
  
N-gga how high, so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' b-tch  
N-gga please, my squad stack plenty of G's  
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees  
  
[Verse 2: J. Cole]  
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl  
My n-ggas hit the trees like squirrels  
Tryna get a nut with your girl  
Think I need to quit trying 'fore some n-gga out there try to hit mine  
Karma for the karma sutra  
A lot calmer when the ganja's through ya  
You need ya armour cause them n-ggas out here tryna shoot ya  
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda  
For stashing that marijuana  
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed  
I broke the law but look I'll never smoke or steal again  
In your courtroom wylin' out, I don't mean to keep smiling  
But right now I'm high enough to probably steal a plane  
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn't read?  
Would you throw the book at me  
What if I'm feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy  
It's been a long time coming  
Tell my n-gga roll me up something  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[J. Cole:]  
No I don't smoke, maybe once in a blue  
When the tention gets thick than there's nothing to do  
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind  
My eyes get shut but I open my mind  
  
How high, la la la la  
How high, hey hey hey  
How high, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
How high, la la la la  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
Is that a shot that you threw little man?  
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned  
Make it worse, you're friends, now when they talk rap  
All you hear is ""J Cole this"" and ""J Cole that""  
It must be hard for your projects to take all that  
I know your weak heart gotta break off that  
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear  
I'm burning you n-ggas and I'm only in first gear  
I'm serving you n-ggas this is only the first beer  
12 months from now, you'll be having the worst year  
No tears for the haters, I'm still counting money  
Cole ain't dropping, that's real f-cking funny  
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a n-gga raps  
Something like a mummy  
But I'm a wake yo' ass up  
Something like your mommy on school day  
I smoke two l's with ya girl this is Cool J  
  
How high  
How high  
How high, yeah  
How high, yeah  
  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
I get a little taste then I'm through with it  
Yeah I send it right back to you with it

J Cole,I'm A Fool,"I'm a fool baby, fool yeah, uh  
If I fuck up, forgive me  
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool, yeah he,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels  
Last year we killed the game  
And left y'all browsing for the clues  
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth  
Money talks and hoes say it's... point of view  
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit  
How can you justify, I testified and there's proof in it  
Through out the years, she'd tears and spill truths  
Somehow they love a nigga better  
When he talk about is loot  
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see light through a wider scope  
And for I know this necklace really represents the news  
Still I hit the jeweler, how much racks to make me cooler  
I just play the game homie, I ain't making rules up  
Started from the bottom, same way you lace your shoes up  
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up  
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television  
Got no plans of seeing hella prison  
You can tell I'm living, right  
I'm a fool  
Never said I'm living right  
Such a fool, for you!  
  
Boy you a fool, boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool, and they like  
And they like, and they like  
Boy you a fool, boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool, and they like  
And they like, and they like  
  
Hey, I'm a fool, hunned thous to go to school  
... debt me, and my mama dared me  
Drowning in the pool  
The first to go to college  
They say knowledge is the truth  
But these hoes on campus, make a young nigga drool  
So we party skip class, get ass and talk cool  
Meanwhile she back home work hard  
I use that as my few  
So I finally graduated,  
But I'm sad to say it, I ain't learn a fucking thing  
Except the game and how to play it  
I'm a fool, no... on my shoes  
No cuts out on prove  
So fuck y'all reviews  
She told me Cole I love you roll with you before the riches  
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches  
And calling brothers niggas  
Pardon if I cross the line  
But all the time thought you was different than  
All them other niggas  
I responded to her please don't put me on a pedestal  
Cause I know better  
And I'm still a fool

J Cole,In the Morning,"Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top

Like the number nine, dime, you fine as hell  
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell  
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'  
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman  
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed  
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees  
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you  
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you  
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me  
Cause girl I caught the vibes like you threw something to me  
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollering, who was that?  
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout do with that?  
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron  
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

And can I hit it in the morning  
Can I hit it in the morning  
And can I hit it in the morning  
The sun rising while you moanin'  
  
Uh, baby you winter time cold  
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow  
I'm tryna make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show  
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go  
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work  
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in  
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian  
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me  
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me  
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking  
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open  
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking  
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion  
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers  
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it  
Yeah, well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning  
I roll over and ask if I can hit  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own  
God bless the woman that can hold Patron  
God bless her home girl that drove us home  
No strings attached, like a cordless phone  
You see my intentions with you is clear  
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear  
Therefore, you shouldn't judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear  
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career  
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah  
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here  
Just say you're scared if you're scared  
But if you through frontin' we can do somethin'  
And you know just what I'm talkin' about,  
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out  
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'  
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward  
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day,  
That's just a warning

Free to love, to each his own  
Free from bills, free from pills  
You roll it loud, the speakers blow  
Life get hard, you eat your soul  
It clears your mind, learn to fly  
Then reach the stars, you take your time  
And look behind and said what I can  
Look how far I done came  
They say that dreams come true  
And when they do that there's a beautiful thing  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free

J Cole,Is She Gon Pop,"Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Art of seduction  
Hoes jump like Vince Carter backstage like they apart of production  
We talked about her dreams you gotta start off with somethin'  
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin'  
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck-in  
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went  
She said your guess is good as mine  
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time  
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga  
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga  
Well, movin on  
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs  
But I love when they come on  
Word?  
  
Ill take it, baby I'll take it  
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked  
Know whats on your mind embrace it, do not fake it

Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mind play?  
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick  
This is superstar dick

Niggas winning off me, it's all G,

So they settling for Tito  
We know, yeah nigga we know  
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino  
Niggas so thirsty it irks me  
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though  
Nah nigga, the game is to get  
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit  
I swear if niggas put half  
Of what they put in chasing ass into a craft  
By now you'd be famous and rich  
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch  
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick,  
She thinking she got a first round pick  
She thinking bout all the things she can get  
She thinking you got a range for a whip  
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause  
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her  
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word  
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver  
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word, wanna ride my nouns  
Let her suck my verbs aye  
  
Ill take it, baby I'll take it  
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked  
Know whats on your mind embrace it, do not fake it  
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it  
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mind play?

This may be the last time you see me free ma  
Don't spend it cryin'  
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'  
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police  
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep  
A drunk and high fool  
Skip a class, fluncking high school  
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned  
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned  
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed  
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned  
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy  
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me  
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me  
At times I wonder 'bout my father  
Would it change for me if he was around?  
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's  
Bum ass n-ggas no jobs, no life  
Seen them n-ggas killed for no price  
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light  
I pulled the trigger momma  
Tryna be hard, I aint mean to kill the n-gga momma  
But what's done is done  
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer  
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer  
  
Yeh, now I'm a killer  
Guess I'm a killer  
They got me in here with the killers  
Yeah I mean the killers  
  
I wonder what's in store for me  
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me  
Than just a simple life  
N-ggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life  
Gave up the jump shot  
Work on the john shot  
Who woulda thought I used to block this n-ggas lay ups  
Now he's in a cell layed up  
I wish you well, stay up  
Like insomniacs  
This life can make a n-gga fold like a laundry mat  
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain  
And so that I react slow, in this fast world  
Slow n-ggas, fast girls  
Hoes give up ass while these ho n-ggas hold triggers  
Blast on 'em  
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em  
Chalk lines by the do not park sign  
It's deep, all these cold hearted n-ggas holding heat  
I'd rather blast before they steal a n-gga  
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer  
  
Yeah, into a killer  
Don't make me turn into a killer  
Yeah, to a killer, yeh yeh  
  
To those who had love for me in the past  
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast  
I remember back in class we used to make believe  
Like it was draft day  
Swore that we would make the league, be rich  
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit  
Watch how they pile up  
Seem like a mile up  
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend  
Skating ring is where we headed tonight  
And if a n-gga disrespect, yes we ready to fight  
In retrospect that shit seemed petty  
At the time, the shit was heavy  
Cause life was all about your name  
You had to scrap with any n-gga that would call you lame  
Ashamed no doubt, so many n-ggas go they brains blown out  
Snatched a n-gga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries  
Another body in a cemetary  
Another young n-gga in the penetentiary  
And he don't give a f-ck no missionary  
Rap visionary, paint a picture n-gga pictionary  
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary  
I knew a n-gga that threw his d-ck in every chick in every city that he went
to  
Went hard like the rent do  
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict  
And he stay on with that thriller

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with  
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with  
  
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills  
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with  
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship  
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit  
That's the least I owed her cause I tried to hit  
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it  
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it  
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless  
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her  
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga  
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative  
Nigga is to hit and never commit  
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets  
So every time I ignore the telephone call  
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call  
She was hurting  
Now she staring dead in my face she was smirking  
Like, ""Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga  
You ain't worth shit, nigga""  
  
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with

I told ya when I get the dough I would pay back  
But I got problems babayy... yea, if you only knew  
I got bigger problems babbayyy  
So why ya talkin about the money that I owe, like as if I didn't know man,  
It don't mean nothing to me

Hey am I wrong, aint you suppose to keep the peace man?  
I coulda swore I was driving pretty peaceful  
So why the hell is you pullin over me fo'?  
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it)  
Or cause I'm black? Hmmm, maybe  
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweatin and I hold my breath everytime that  
You get behind me  
I turn my music down, so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got  
A couple pounds on me  
You pulled me over, you frown on me

Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky  
My teacher said, ""Impossible"", but I'mma fuckin try  
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules  
There's niggas dying everyday, but we don't make the news  
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones  
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods ""be f-ckin all these white

Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness  
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic

What you say ""Cole ain't hot,""  
What? Where you read that shit?  
You believe that shit?  
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?  
Have you seen my shows?  
Have you seen my hoes?  
If I wasn't hot would they be so thick?  
Guess not, got the game in a headlock  
I'm blasting that, I'm laughin' at you old niggas, Redd Foxx  
Don't mind me boy, I'm red hot, uh, nigga they not  
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere, they not  
You never play me, nice try, balling in a nice spot  
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch  
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot  
So, you can look, but don't touch,  
I stay on my toes like the White Sox  
  
[Chorus]  
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch  
They say time is money but really it's not  
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got  
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back  
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here  
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year  
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care  
Like I make that back, fuck it I make that back  
Nice watch, nice watch, nice watch  
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch  
  
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high-roller  
Now it's racks on racks, never thought that I would ride Rover  
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober  
Cole World but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?  
Young, black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas Eve  
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench, no wonder why I didn't quit the team  
I'm cut from a different sleeve, Cole World 'til our wrists are freeze  
Hurry up with your pictures please, I gotta make history

I got a Hublot, I call it Tebow,  
I strap that bitch with a gator band  
Y'all niggas ball half-time,  
Y'all niggas like the Gator band  
Y'all niggas need a time out,  
Who got these niggas all wound up?  
Cocksucker, I'm seven thirty,  
Y'all know where y'all niggas gonna wind up?  
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch  
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit yall niggas with a nice shot  
Y'all niggas betta not call the law, get no blood on my Audemar  
Meaning y'all better not waste my time  
When y'all ready I take you all to war  
Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors  
Put the front on the back, cause I'm back and forth  
Put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss  
So I'm fronting on niggas when I'm backing off  
What up, Cole?  
It's your time, let's these niggas know  
Adjust your Rollie on these motherfucking hoes,  
Whenever you ready, go  
  
It cost me a lot (oh yeah)

Oh yeah  
  
This is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated  
Old hoes we dated, look mama, we made it  
Your son out in Barbados, cheese eggs and potatoes  
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Play Dough  
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' about girls  
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls and vandalizin' her curls  
Sweating her weave out, moans as she breathes out  
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stout  
I step over piranha, death over dishonor  
They killin niggas for J's, that's death over designer  
Hey Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna  
Remember when I used to be stressed over Dawana  
Now a nigga only textin' distress over Rihannas  
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters  
And we always argue about the same thing  
Tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing?  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey  
But you're perfect for me  
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey,  
But you're perfect for me  
We rollin', we ridin'  
He like to go inside and  
I love to go all night and  
We rock the boat, Poseidon  
I love to call your name, name, name  
Baby I love to call your name, name, name  
  
Oh yeah, to my college girl,  
Take the weekend off and come home soon  
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room  
But that thing tight like Fort Knox  
So I call you when the tour stops  
But baby with your roommates,  
Did you make sure the door's locked?  
She love it when we get together  
Smoke a little weed but her shit together  
Now that I'm on, I can pick and choose  
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose  
Yeah, I heard stories about different dudes  
Her man on campus but it's fine by me  
She say she only fucked like four five niggas,  
So you know you gotta multiply by three

J Cole,Rise And Shine,"There's a nigga right now somewhere  
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks  
And he's reading the back of the cereal  
And in between the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit  
And he wants my spot  
I'ma find him though, I'ma sign him.  
I don't want no problems  
  
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind  
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed  
Took my time, crept from behind  
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine!  
Cole World, same nigga used to drive around with yo girl  
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it  
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it  
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic  
Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit  
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow and niggas went nuts for  
The boy that set fire to the booth  
In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth  
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof  
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots  
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose  
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot  
Bang!  
  
[Chorus]  
Before I wake  
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take  
My soul to take, my soul to take, my soul to take  
  
Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life caper  
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker  
Our hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker  
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan  
More than a rapper this a natural disaster  
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina  
""Shut up, Cole!"", this is for my niggas back home  
Homes, waddup Bo?  
This is for them bitches that played me, waddup ho?  
No I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad  
Two kids that don't even know their real dad  
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it  
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic  
It's Cole still at it, y'all be talkin' about the same shit  
Than how I feel about it, mama was a real addict  
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'  
Cole plannin' funerals, you might fit the coffin

Get on your job lil man, this ain't Saturday!  
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate  
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake  
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier  
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute  
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it  
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it  
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it  
But it's just a nigga God invented  
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it  
Word, this shit ain't vibe nigga, why you noddin' with it?  
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it  
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked  
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me  
'Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga  
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga  
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga  
You saved so many hoes, you a hero nigga!  
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac  
When he slept with Madonna  
Hey, this is death before dishonor  
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama  
She got enough to stress about  
My nigga gonna get me out  
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors  
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records  
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?  
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it  
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it  
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it  
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?  
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set  
It goes tick-tock, game on lock  
Sun gon' shine but the rain won't stop  
Oh no!  
  
If I should die before I wake  
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take  
My soul to take, my soul to take

We just get right nigger, we don't get left  
Fuck what they said,

So many that's in jail, or they're dead right now  
One time for my nigger crag right now  
He in the feds, damn the times change  
And these stupid niggers talking 'bout crime pays  
You can keep that shit, I just made a million  
Call me when reach that shit  
I ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light  
One time for my granny up would happen tonight  
And a young boy from a show down in hampton  
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer  
Didn't know what to say, I just froze  
Little too deep I suppose

I told niggas on the low, but they ain't hear it though  
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle  
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow  
We eating better than we was a few years ago  
Send you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it's May day  
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors  
Bill collectors blowing us up, the couldn't fade us  
Bitch I made straight A's, go 'head, try and degrade us, haters  
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones  
Collecting money, a lesson for me: everybody's got a story dog  
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog  
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog  
With hits like a porno blog  
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour  
Ain't judging though, to each his own  
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home  
More power to you, but a message to you f-ck niggas  
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna f-ck with you  
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time  
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine  
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new  
Same old, f-ck it though, what's up with you?  
If you made it this far listening without skipping  
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting  
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission  
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position  
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen  
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate  
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!  
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping  
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?  
Yeah that was random, but man, so is life  
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right  
I find myself fiendin' for a spot to go at night

The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life

Will it last? Or will it pass?

Dog, welcome to fame  
I pray to God we don't change  
But even if you don't

Wasn't nothin' like that  
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time  
She was in my math class  
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass  
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes  
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes  
It started off so innocent  
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it  
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool  
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school  
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her  
Got me daydreaming, man what  
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it  
Make it hard for me to stand up  
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and  
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'  
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before  
She wrote a note that said ""You ever had sex before?""  
Damn  
  
[Hook]  
And I ain't never did this before, no (x8)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I wrote back and said, ""Of course I had sex before,"" knowing I was frontin'  
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowing I was stuntin'  
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out, son  
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one  
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me  
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me  
My mama gone for the weekend  
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""  
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'  
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up  
I'm thinking how that body look naked when you laying on the bed  
Teacher, please don't make me stand up  
I wrote back like ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan""  
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man  
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned  
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin  
Fuck  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know that feeling when you you finna bone for the first time  
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time  
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with  
And most of all I'm praying, ""God don't let me bust quick""  
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right  
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right  
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'  
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection  
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing  
And a nigga roll over on top  
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing  
On me, ooh girl don't stop  
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I
practiced  
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said  
""I wanna get something off my mental  
I can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, cause""

When you was leaving, did he put up a fight  
Was he stressing you, wasn't fucking you right  
Well one man's trash is another man's treasure  
One man's pain is another man's pleasure  
One damn thing you can't change is the weather  
But even if it rain, we get rained on together  
It's whatever, you shine, I shine  
I know you got a 9-5 I'll be your 5-9  
  
[Refrain]  
  
[Verse 2:  
Yeah, go ahead and pop it like you do in the mirror  
I'm picking through the crowd tryna see a little clearer  
High heel wearer, hell of a body  
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody  
Nope, I'm peeking at your ass, winking at your ass  
If I don't bag I'll be thinking bout your ass  
For the whole week, no time for cold feet  
She too bad to pass, so fine I'm gon' speak  
I tell her my name Jermaine  
I'm tryna be low key  
She tell me I got that flame, your rhymes are so deep  
Man, girl thank you  
Shit you so bad know your daddy wish he could still spank you  
Hold up for these other niggas roll up and try and get ya  
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya  
I'm tryna vibe with ya so won't you throw me your phone number  
And let them lames get your old number  
  
[Refrain]  
  
[Verse 3: Wale]  
Roc Nation, Wale  
Look, Cole world, still a cold world  
And a couple you is cool but we a little more thorough  
Whole time, a little more girls  
You know I spit that sick shit and there's still no cure  
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer  
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther  
Love my women with high heels and high standards  
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers  
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat  
I ain't superstitious I make all these broads split my pole  
You dig it, this shit ain't for beginners  
I'm something like a fetus, I'm not quite kidding  
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block your vision  
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop  
Hundred K in twenty-two hours  
See money talks, you muthafuckers is Boomhauer  
No check back, in debt yep  
Loud in my jay, y'all smoke that gallaudet  
Higher than I need to be  
Flyer cause I need to be  
Love our conversation but it's late right now  
I need to beat  
One time for the Ville that Cole rep  
Another time for the city of slow death  
I don't understand why these niggas so vexed  
I don't need no chains with no cross to know that I'm blessed

There ain't any truth to it  
The fact is you're lying

I know what I lost before it's gone

Oh, say I'm overreacting  
As if you believe in that  
But you answer questions  
That nobody even asked  
Although we may stay together  
Down in your heart, you know better  
You pictured all the ways that you'll move on

Throw out the lifeline  
I've been sinking  
Going out of my mind  
I've been thinking  
If I could hold her  
Make this storm blow over  
  
Give me a taste of satisfaction  
Oh, I need to learn her  
I need her faster  
I'm so wide open  
Won't you come right over?  
Won't you come?

Though its wrong its hard to tell the truth  
But she don't have to know  
She don't have to know  
  
When I meet cha  
I got my shades on to cover up my eyes  
I'm hoping that nobody sees me passing by  
Through my disguise  
I still know you recognize  
  
But you  
I know you got a lil secret of your own  
Sneaking out with me while your mans at home  
You know your wrong  
But its so strong still carrying on  
  
I go  
To the other side of town so I  
Will never risk the chance of catching her eye  
'Cause she don't have to know  
She don't have to know  
Ooohhhh  
Girl I know your doing the same thing too  
But I won't tell your man the things we do oh no  
'Cause he don't have to know  
He don't have to know  
  
Someone's watching  
We got to be careful next time or we're through

Damn it's so stressful doing the dirt we do  
So sad but true  
And I know one day  
I'm going to pay  
  
Then you ask me  
To sneak out of town for just a day or three  
(One, two, three)  
Go to D.C. and hold hands publicly  
All through the streets  
Cause they don't know you and they don't know me

But there's no reason that we should tell her today

John Legend,Shine,"They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside.  
I love to see their face, can we spare the light?  
Are we afraid to see the prisoners of history?  
These beautiful minds, trapped inside.  
Bring them back to life.  
  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
  
So dark, but I see sparks, if we don't snuff them out.  
We gotta light them flame, let them speak their name.  
Let them reach up to the clouds.  
Can't eat if we don't feed them.  
Can't read if we don't teach them.  
There's no line if we just hide them.  
Don't just let 'em die.  
  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
  
Oh stars flicker in the distance, lonely out in space.  
They sing out when we're not listening, because we don't see their face.  
We can let them die, we can make them high.  
Hold the little miracles that live inside.  
Let 'em shine.  
  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em live.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em read on.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em grow.  
Let 'em shine on.

I realize as I lay down to sleep, we haven't spoke in weeks  
So many things that I'd like to know...  
Come have a talk with me  
I need a sign, something I can see  
Why all the mystery?  
I try not to fall for make-believe, but what is reality?  
  
Where do we go, what do we know?  
Life has to have a meaning  
Show me the light, show me the way  
Show that you're listening  
Show me, that you love me  
Show me that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watchin over me  
  
Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you for all you've given me  
Sometimes the price of what you gave to me,  
I can't stop questioning  
Oh God of love, peace, and mercy, why so much suffering?  
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me  
Wonder if you're listening...  
  
When people go, why do they go?  
Why don't you choose me?  
But someday I'll know that I'm gonna go  
I hope you're waiting for me  
  
Show me that you love me  
Show nme that you walk with me

Right now I'll take it easy  
Won't spend my time waiting to die

John Legend,Sin City,"10 a.m. it's west side bitch  
She see the glasses, so obvious  
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here  
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there  
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night  
She run her mouth, but can't eat right  
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white  
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white  
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us  
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless? SMH,  
We all know that cocaine killed Abel  
From the scholar letters devour this  
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold  
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul  
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know  
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy  
  
I'm here with open arms and I got her  
Here is where her heart belongs, her heart belongs with me  
Here is where her heart  
I'm here and I won't go without her  
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me  
Here is where her heart  
  
I beg for mercy today  
They won't take me away  
Take me away from you  
Don't know what I would do  
Don't let us die in vain  
Don't let them see our pain  
Wash these demons away  
Wash these demons away  
  
You are all unwelcome to Sin City  
Yet the population still increases its density  
And that increases its intensity  
Which increases the propensity  
To complicate your simplicity  
No matter your ethnicity  
All for the sake of publicity, in this city  
  
Huh, bad bitches with ass shots  
Use a house as a stash spot  
Lexus coupe with the rag-top  
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot  
I used to run with the have-nots  
Kept the ave' hot just so we could have knots  
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot  
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot  
We broke all the commandments  
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched  
Come spend a day in my Hamlet  
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis  
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis  
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch  
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it  
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices  
But this life'll take a toll on ya  
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices  
I know who Christ is  
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous  
By the age ten, we were caged in  
Now they raise men in the state pen  
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins  
God bless the city, amen  
  
I'm here with open arms and I got her  
Here is where her heart belongs her heart belongs with me  
Here is where her heart  
I'm here and I won't go without her  
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me  
  
And now I'm one of the residents  
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence  
And all the fuckin' debauchery  
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me  
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like  
'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight  
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right  
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite  
But I am willing to share tonight  
In the city that is as unfair as life

Turn down the bed and the blinds  
Before your turn around  
Can you just stay through the night?  
Let me breathe you in 'til gravity bends  
And we fall through the hole in the light  
Make this our kingdom  
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide

I feel it in my chest  
Know I won't let the blue flame die  
We can't lose hope just yet

And we're scared to love but it's alright  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I know that we're surefire, yeah  
Know that we're surefire, yeah

Can't keep this bed warm on the left side

John Legend,Take Me Away,"Yeah, yeah  
  
We danced and sing, somewhere in between heaven and hell  
Gabrielle, that was her name  
Everyone was smiling, even through their tears, under her spell  
But in Gabrielle's eyes, nothing  
I asked, ""Do you not like the music?""  
She said, ""It's alright""  
But she dances to her own side  
So she says,  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me away from here  
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing  
I don't care where we go as long as I'm there with you, baby  
  
Long as I'm there with you  
  
I could tell, she's been through pain I could only dream  
Nightmares live where you live  
Tears were in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall  
I get the world to know a her smile is  
I asked, ""Do you dance with me now?""  
Let me try to figure out  
The fastest round out of town  
And she says,

Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce  
Eggplant double-breasted suit from Tom Ford  
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog  
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss  
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us  
Still actin' shy like this is summer class crush  
Money comin' fast, I'm never in a rush, no  
Plus another twenty in a tuck  
Semi in a truck, another forty on the wrist  
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin' like I pitch  
Dodging Robin Givens, boiling like I'm Roger Clemens  
Still in the game, uniform all linen  
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail  
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale  
  
And I, I'm not afraid to fly  
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing  
And we're not afraid to die  
Who do we think we are?

Justin Timberlake,Gimme What I Don't Know,"[Intro]  
Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle  
  
[Verse 1]  
Why are you standing so far away?  
Running men is looking on. Why...  
Why don't you come out to play?  
And get closer to your animal, inside  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ready I act like the gentleman that your mother would love,  
(Ooh, get to know me)  
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up,  
(Things you wanna show me)  
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love,  
(Please be slowly)  
I think you're ready to try,  
Walk a little closer and...  
  
[Chorus]  
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid  
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage  
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know (don't know), I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
  
[Verse 2]  
Show me your T-shirt, and spreed your wings (your wings)  
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud  
Play it breeze, but you wild as a strain  
Sorry, show it for the whole crowd  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ready I act like the gentleman that your mother would love,  
(Ooh, get to know me)  
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up,

Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want

Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know (don't know), I want

Justin Timberlake,Gone,"There's a thousand words that  
I could say, to make you come home, yeah  
Seems so long ago you walked away  
Left me alone  
And I remeber what you said to me,  
You were acting so strange  
And maybe I was too blind to see  
That you needed a change  
  
Was it something I said to make you turn away  
To make you walk out and leave me cold  
If I could just find a way  
To make it so that you were right here, right now  
  
I've been sitting here  
Can't get you off my mind  
I'm trying my best to be a man and be strong  
I drove myself insane, wishing I could touch your face  
But the truth remains, you're Gone  
  
Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby  
Won't change the fact that you're gone  
But if there's something that I could do, won't you please let me know  
Time is passing so slowly now, guess that's my life without you  
And maybe I could change my everyday, but baby I don't want to  
  
So I'll just hang around and find some things to do  
To take my mind off missing you  
And I know in my heart, you can't say that you don't love me too  
Please say you do, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What will I do if I can't be with you  
Tell me where will I turn to, baby who will I be  
Now that we are apart, am I still in your heart?  
Baby why don't you see that I need you here with me?

Justin Timberlake,Hallelujah,"Well I heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the lord  
But you don't really care for music, do ya?  
  
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall and the major lift  
The baffled king composing hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you to a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Maybe there's a god above  
All I ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
And it's not a cry you can hear at night  
Not somebody who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah

Different DNA, they don't understand you

Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonce'  
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey  
Remember him from blackstreet  
He was as black as the street was  
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was  
I never could see why people'll reach a  
Fake-ass versad that they couldn't keep up  
Ya see how I creeped up?  
Ya see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?  
I never rock a mink coat in a winter time like Killa Cam  
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am  
Let me know if you feel it man  
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everybody sayin' what's not for him  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again

Haters, start your engines  
I hear 'em gearin' up  
People talkin' so much shit about me at barbershops  
They forget to get their haircut  
Okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up  
Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough  
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos  
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows  
So say goodbye to the N-double-A-C-P award  
Goodbye to the India Arie award  
They'd rather give me the nigga-please award  
But I'll just take the I-got-a-lot a-cheese award  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this  
But I got the facts to back this  
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets  
Man, killin's some wack shit  
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'  
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?  
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin  
I need to talk to somebody, pastor  
The church want time, so I can't afford to pay  
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay  
My 15 seconds up, but I got more to say  
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everybody sayin' what's not for him  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again

Kanye West,Extravaganza,"Jamie Fox, featuring Kanye West  
  
First Verse:  
  
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out  
Tired of being cramped up in the house  
We were simply celebrating life  
Off from work today, so it's all right  
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist  
Started dancing with this model chick  
Then every record became our favorite song  
And that is all that I remember  
  
Chorus:  
  
Cuz I had one too many drinks  
And ended up at the Embassy  
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee  
It was a one night extravaganza  
  
Second Verse:  
  
When I woke up from last night's ""salvatry""  
Baby doll was laying next to me  
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where  
I got dress and got up out of there  
But not before I call for me a cab  
Hung over from all the drinks I had  
And now I'm telling my story to you  
Every thing that I remember  
  
Repeat Chorus: 2x  
  
Bridge:  
  
Extravaganza, Extravaganza  
Only was an extravaganza  
Yes, it was  
The things that I remember  
  
Kanye West's Rap:  
(And I remember)  
Being at the bar  
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo'  
Knowing that I can't afford to get mo'  
Here's a broke nigga trick  
Buy one bottle and sip slow  
Or, or leave the club now  
Do like I did  
Come back when you get dough  
A fish stick nigga  
Now we messing with lobsters  
We messing with Grammies  
We messing with Oscars  
You messing with that dranky drank  
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank  
In the morning, you g'on draw a blank  
The hotel said that y'all was on one  
My girl wasn't on shit  
I picked the wrong one  
Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls  
Well tonite, I'm trying to find them other girls  
Bring they own rubber girl  
Neva meet 'cha mother girl  
You know they love it, when you love them  
And they tell they friends, girrrllllll

Kanye West,Family Business,"This is family business  
And this is for the family that can't be with us  
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us  
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet  
Like a photo of your granny's picture  
Now that you're gone it hit us  
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right  
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life  
Somebody please say grace so I can save face  
And have a reason to cover my face  
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it  
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it  
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?  
As kids we used to laugh  
Who knew that life would move this fast?  
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?  
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it  
And if you did, then that's family business  
  
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things  
  
This is family business  
And this is for everybody standin' with us  
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture  
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?  
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV""  
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it  
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite  
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider  
But when we get together be electric slidin'  
Grandma, get 'em shook up  
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up  
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name  
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane  
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude  
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food  
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins  
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins  
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins  
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all  
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg  
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed  
  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
  
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind  
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns  
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God  
And keep your face to the risin' sun  
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog  
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog  
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog  
You can still love your man and be manly dog  
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'  
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman  
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?  
The second she storms out then he storms in  
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion  
And drink some wine like Communion  
And act like everything fine and if it isn't  
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business  
  
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
They don't mean a thing  
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing, a thing  
  
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for

Kanye West,Heard 'em Say,"(Mr. West) Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah  
  
And I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way  
So this is in the name of love, like a rob would say  
Before you ask me to get a job today,  
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?  
And I know the Government administered AIDS  
So I guess we just pray like the minister say  
Allah O'Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars  
Things we seen on the screen are not ours  
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far  
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars  
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars  
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it  
  
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a
way  
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only
way)  
  
They say people in your life are seasons  
And anything that happen is for a reason  
And niggas guns a clappin' and keep to squeezin'  
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'  
And Jesus, one day that ya see him  
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him  
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'  
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'  
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us  
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down  
Now my 'lil cousin smokin' those cigarettes now  
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now  
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?  
I can't figure it out, I'm stickin' around

Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life  
  
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit  
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they shit  
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation  
I was really makin' myself, they competition  
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game  
Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains  
Just picture man, no snitchin' man  
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man  
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave  
'Til I pulled out my map  
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas  
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more  
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed  
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game  
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid  
All my niggas about to have it made  
This makes everything else sound played  
Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!  
Now hold up  
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog  
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)  
I told dude ""You can't even rap on my interlude""  
Now does that make me as rude as you?  
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'  
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion  
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion  
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks  
And let's not even bring up the tracks man  
Nope, nope, let's not do that man  
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man  
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fangs  
  
[Chorus: Kanye West]  
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life  
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up  
Throw your diamonds

Let's take it there, take it there man  
It's not supposed to be...  
(GLC where you at nigga?)  
  
How many niggas you know put their life on the line and get signed  
Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime  
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count  
How could I mic out, just look at my account  
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all  
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'  
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'  
When I copied hounds it was my best investment  
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson  
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses  
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants  
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy  
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'  
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard  
Man look at your haircut  
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks  
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters  
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter  
Even did it on his crime picture and ye  
And offers to sell and yell, uh

Kanye West,Homecoming,"I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
I met this girl when I was 3 years old  
And what I loved most she had so much soul  
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me  
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""  
And from that point I never blow her off  
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off  
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off  
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft  
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown  
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding  
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be  
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave  
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me  
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me  
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me  
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Maybe we can start again  
  
But if you really cared for her  
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams  
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her  
It always seems like she talking 'bout me  
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you  
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you  
But they just not you"" and I just got through  
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do: just not new  
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong  
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone  
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home  
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home  
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud  
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud  
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around  
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
Maybe you, do you remember when?  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan  
Oh, now I'm coming home again  
Maybe you, do you remember when?  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan

Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly  
I know He hear me when my feet get weary  
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct  
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think  
I ain't here to argue about his facial features  
Or here to convert atheists into believers  
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers  
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus  
So here go my single dog radio needs this  
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus  
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape  
But if I talk about God my record won't get played  
Huh?  
Well let this take away from my spins  
Which will probably take away from my ends  
Then I hope this take away from my sins  
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about  
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

Kanye West,My Way,"I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday  
The ROC got ""-Ye"" but they ain't snortin' it  
They just got him up the base line recordin' shit  
Yeah I've been broke  
Now I'm good bitch  
I ain't no Kennedy  
But I'm hood rich  
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto  
And everybody else, thank you very little  
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path  
I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past  
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last  
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though  
We needed cash  
And we need it fast  
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last  
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white  
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white  
Almost  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Niggaz wanna diss K  
On they're local mix-tapes  
There they go again, lyin' to consumers  
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors  
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya  
A little arrogant with all your compares  
'Cause as far as the Chi  
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap  
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that  
Y'all just talk about my dough  
How I left Chicago  
How I'm the only one eatin'  
Shut your pie hole  
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though  
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro  
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?  
Only difference between you and me, you were gay  
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?  
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways  
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way  
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v  
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway  
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay  
We stay 4 stars, all better  
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather  
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better  
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas  
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial  
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's  
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg  
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg  
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg  
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
I did it my way

You'd hurt yourself to make me stay  
This is crazy, this is crazy (This is crazy, uh-huh!)  
  
I keep letting you back in  
How can I explain myself?  
As painful as this thing has been  
I just can't be with no one else  
See I know what we've got to do  
You let go, and I'll let go too  
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you  
And no one ever will  
  
No matter how I think we grow  
You always seem to let me know  
It ain't workin', It ain't workin' (It ain't workin')  
And when I try to walk away  
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay  
This is crazy, this is crazy  
  
Care for me, care for me!  
I know you care for me!  
  
There for me, there for me!  
Said you'd be there for me!

Lauryn Hill,Final Hour,"I treat this like my thesis  
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces  
I introduce then produce  
Words so profuse it's abuse how I juice up this beat  
Like I'm deuce, two people both equal  
Like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon  
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it  
You can't stop it, drop it  
Your whole crew's microscopic  
Like particles while I make international articles  
And on the cover  
Don't discuss the baby mother business  
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness  
First handed I'm candid  
You can't stand it, respect demanded  
And get flown around the planet  
Rock Hard like granite or steel  
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel  
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads  
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
  
I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest  
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis  
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it  
You gonna fall trying to ball  
While my team win the pennant  
I'm about to begin it  
For a minute, then run for senate  
Make a slum lord be the tenant give his money to kids to spend it  
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented  
Our survival since our arrival  
Documented in The Bible, like Moses and Aaron  
Things gon' change, it's apparent  
And all the transparent gonna  
Be seen through, let God redeem you  
Keep your deen true  
You can get the green too  
Watch out what you cling to  
Observe how a queen do  
And I remain calm reading the 73 Psalm  
'Cause with all this going on I got the world in my palm  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
  
Now I be breaking bread sipping  
Manichevitz wine  
Pay no mind party like it's 1999  
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine  
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind  
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller  
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella  
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture  
Or collecting residuals from off The Score  
I'm making sure I'm with the 144  
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war  
Word to Boonie  
I makes a lot like a Sunni  
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community  
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic  
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep  
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship  
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip  
(Every time i take sips!)  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!

Fling skin grin while them plotting for you true!  
  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Me nah tellin' them no more)  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Be real, them not a clue!)  
Beware the false motives of others  
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers  
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you  
To you  
They say all the right things, to gain their position  
Then use your kindness as their ammunition  
to shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do  
Oh  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
  
Why every Indian want to be the chief?  
Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef  
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece  
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?  
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?  
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets  
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek  
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik  
and other African czars, observing stars with war scars  
Get yours in this capitalistic system  
So many caught or got bought you can't list them  
How you gonna idolize the missing?  
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition  
even when they comin', gunnin' I stand position  
L's known the mission since conception  
Let's free the people from deception  
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions  
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto  
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto  
Why black people always be the ones to settle?  
March through these streets like Soweto, uh  
  
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus  
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
It took me a little while to discover  
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers  
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves  
A friend once said, and I found to be true  
that everyday people, they lie to God too  
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Forgive dem, forgive dem)  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Forgive dem, forgive dem)

Time to get free, or give yourselves up now  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time  
[Rapping]  
Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory  
For the dominion  
Who will dominate the opinion  
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion  
Conformin' our vision  
To the world church of decision  
Trapped in a section  
Submitted to committing election  
Moral infection  
Epidemic lies and deception  
Insurrection  
Of the highest possible order  
Destortin' our tape recorders  
From hearin' like under water  
Beyond the borders  
Find the sin in disorder  
Bound by the strategy  
A systematic deprivaty  
Heavy as gravity  
Head first in the cavity  
Without a bottom  
A fate, worse than Sodom  
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits  
Truth comes, we can't hear it  
When you've been, programmed to fear it  
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision  
Apallin', callin' religious  
Some program on television  
How can, dominant wisdom  
Be recognized in the system  
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules  
Intelligent fools  
PhD's in illusion  
Masters of massconfusion  
Bachelors in past illusion  
Now who you choosin'  
The head, the tail  
The bloodshed of male  
Or confidence in the tale  
Conference is in Yale  
Discussin' doctrines of bail  
Causin' people to fail  
Keepin' the third in jail  
His word is nail  
Everything to the tree  
Severing all of me  
From all that I used to be  
Formless and void  
Totally paranoid  
Enjoy darkness as Lord  
Keepin' me from the sword  
Block for mercy  
Bitter than cerasee  
Hungry and thirsty  
For good meat we would eat  
And still, dined at the table of deceit  
How incomplete  
From confrontation to retreat  
We belong, the true enemies defeat  
Destitute a necessity  
Causin' desperation to get the best of me  
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me  
Realizin' the inescapable death of me  
No options in the valley of decision  
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision  
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart  
From words to fiery darts  
Thrown by the workers of the arts  
Iniquity, shapen in  
There's no escapin' when  
Your whole philosophy is paper thin  
In vanity  
The wide road is insanity  
Could it be all of humanity  
Picture that  
Scripture that  
The origin of a man's heart is black  
How can we show up for  
An invisible war  
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore  
Achin' in sores  
Babylon, the great mystery  
Mother of human history  
System of social sorcery  
Our present condition  
Needs serious recognition  
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission  
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam  
The atom bomb is Saddam and Minister Farakkkhan  
What's goin' on, what's the priority to you  
What authority do we do  
When the majority hasn't a clue  
We majored in curses  
Search the chapters, check the verses  
Recapture the land  
Remove the mark from off of our hands  
So we can stand  
In agreement with his command  
Everything else is damned  
Let them with ears understand  
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now

It's freedom time, said it's freedom time  
Everybody knows that they've lied  
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside  
Everybody knows that they guilty, yes  
Resting on their conscience eating their insides

A beautiful reflection of his grace  
For I know that a gift so great  
Is only one god could create  
And I'm reminded every time I see your face  
  
That the joy of my world is in Zion  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
  
Marching, marching, marching to Zion  
Marching, marching  
Marching, marching, marching to Zion  
Beautiful, beautiful Zion

Lauryn Hill,War In The Mind,"Everybody knows that they're guilty  
Everybody knows that they've lied  
Everybody knows that they're guilty  
Resting on their conscience eating their inside  
It's freedom, I said it's freedom time now  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now  
Time to get free, or give your selves up now  
It's freedom, said it's free time yo  
There's a war in the mind over territory, for the dominium  
Who will dominate the opinions?  
Schisms and isms, keeping us in forms of religion  
Conforming our vision to the world church of decision  
Trapped in a section, submitted to committing election  
Moral affection, epidemic lies and deception  
Insurrection, of the highest possible order  
Distorting our tape recorders from hearin' it like underwater  
Beyond the borders, find the sin in disorder  
Bound by the strategy of a systemic depravity  
Heavy as gravity, head first in the cavity without a bottom  
A fate, worst then Sodom,  
What's gotem drunk of the spirit?  
Truth comes we can't hear it when you've been programmed to fear it  
I had a vision I was falling in indecision  
Appalling, calling religious a program on television  
How can... Dominate wisdom  
Be recognized in the system  
Of antichrists'? The majority rules  
Intelligent fools  
P. H. D. 's in illusion, masters of mass confusion  
Bachelors of past illusion  
Now who you choosing?  
The head or the tail?  
The bloodshed of the male or confidence in the veil?  
Conferences at Yale discussing doctrines of Baal  
Causing peoples to fail keeping a third in jail  
His words nailed everything to the tree  
Severing all of me from all that I use to be  
Formless and void, totally paranoid  
Enjoyed darkness's, Lord keeping me from the sword

Keep my distance from your lies

Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midriff  
Dark all I do embark the shadows  
Involved with my thought catalog, analogue, rap catalog  
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence  
The twisted web of tangled lies  
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste  
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes  
Against the state of being  
Feeling the weight-less-ness pressed between the ceiling  
Reeling around room  
Riding a bubble of sound proof  
It's the frequency making you  
Sha-Shake with every boom  
Involuntary muscle contraction  
Ignoring and drinking musical gas field euphoria  
The sound pounds to make the dead flush  
To have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff

I'm safe here in my room  
Unless I try to start again

'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

Or why I have to scream  
I don't know why I instigate  
And say what I don't mean  
I don't know how I got this way  
I know it's not alright  
So I'm breaking the habit

Clutching my cure  
I tightly lock the door  
I try to catch my breath again  
I hurt much more than any time before  
I have no options left again  
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose

As explosions broke in the sky  
All that I needed  
Was the one thing I couldn't find  
And you were there at the turn  
Waiting to let me know

To break it back down  
We're building it up  
To burn it down  
We can't wait  
To burn it to the ground  
  
The colors conflicted  
As the flames, climbed into the clouds  
I wanted to fix this  
But couldn't stop from tearing it down  
And you were there at the turn  
Caught in the burning glow  
And I was there at the turn

You held me high  
And I believed when you told that lie  
I played soldier, you played king  
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring  
You lost that right, to hold that crown  
I built you up, but you let me down  
So when you fall, I'll take my turn

Linkin Park,By Myself,"What do I do to ignore them behind me?  
Do I follow my instincts blindly?  
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams  
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?  
Do I sit here and try to stand it?  
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?  
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,  
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?  
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin  
I make the right moves but I'm lost within  
I put on my daily facade but then  
I just end up getting hurt again  
By myself (myself)  
  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on.  
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.  
It's all too much to take in.  
I can't hold on.  
To end things watching everything spin.  
With thoughts of failure sinking in.  
  
If I turn my back I'm defenseless  
And to go blindly seems senseless  
If I hide my pride and let it all go on  
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone  
If I let them go I'll be outdone  
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun  
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer  
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer  
By myself (myself)  
  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself

How do you think  
I've lost so much  
I'm so afraid  
I'm out of touch  
How do you expect  
I will know what to do  
When all I know  
Is what you tell me to  
  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself  
I'm stuck on the outside  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself

Linkin Park,Empty Spaces,"I am not a pattern that we follow  
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow  
I'm not a criminal not a role model  
Not a born leader I'm a tough act to follow  
I am not the fortune and the fame  
Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain  
And found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse  
Because even a blueprint is a gift and a curse  
Because once you get a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be like the first  
And I'm not a robot. I'm not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beat's funky  
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk  
Stop talking and start trying to catch up motherfucker  
  
And all the people say  
Try and catch up motherfucker  
  
Pac said money changes situation  
Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said don't step I ain't the one  
Chuck said an uzi weighs a motherfucking tone  
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
  
I'm awfully underrated but pay me to correct it  
And so it ain't mistaken I'm gonna state it for record  
I am the opposite of where I got this  
A weak opposite, a slack sending them  
A heat sending them  
A crack closest to a peak  
Far from a punk  
Ya'll better start trying to catch up motherfucker

Come for me, I'll be gone  
But when they come for me  
Come for me, I'll be gone

Linkin Park,Hands Held High,"Turn my mic up louder,  
I got to say something.  
Lightweights stepping aside,  
When we come in.  
Feel it in your chest,  
The syllables get pumping.  
People on the street,  
They panic and start running.  
Words on loose leaf,  
Sheet complete coming.  
I jump on my mind,  
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.  
Healing the blind,  
I promise to let the sun in.  
Sick of the dark ways,  
We march to the drumming.  
Jump when they tell us  
They want to see jumping.  
Fuck that, I want to  
See some fist pumping.  
Risk something.  
Take back what's yours  
Say something that you know  
They might attack you for  
'Cause I'm sick of being treated  
Like I had before.  
Like it's stupid standing for  
What I'm standing for.  
Like this war is really just  
A different brand of war.  
Like it doesn't cater the rich  
And an abandon the poor.  
Like they understand you  
In the back of the jet,  
When you can't put gas in your tank.  
These fuckers are laughing their way  
To the bank and cashing their check  
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.  
  
For a leader so nervous  
In an obvious way  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
In the living room laughing  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen  
  
In my living room watching,  
But I am not laughing.  
'Cause when it gets tense,  
I know what might happen.  
The world is cold,  
The bold men take action.  
Have to react,  
Or get blown into fractions.  
Ten years old is something to see,  
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,  
Taken and bound and found later under a tree,  
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me"".  
Do you see?  
The soldiers they're out today.  
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.  
It's ironic,  
At times like this you pray,  
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.  
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads,  
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes,  
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know  
But enough pride inside not to let that show.  
My brother had a book he would hold with pride  
A little red cover with a broken spine.  
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside,  
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.  
  
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
Both scared and angry  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.

Into a sky so blue  
As the ocean opens up  
To swallow you.

With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high

The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.

Wondering what I think of you well I protect you out of courtesy  
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away  
Afraid to say what was on my mind  
Afraid to say what I need to say  
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around  
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down  
But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand  
So I wait till the upper hand is mine  
  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think you've won  
And then it's all gone  
  
So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies  
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside  
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long  
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on  
There are so many things you say that make me feel you cross the line  
What goes up will surely fall, and I am counting down the time  
Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand  
So I waiting until the upper hand is mine

The next you're not, watch it drop

Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top

Bet the fall of the rhyme for the sake of my mom  
She's like ""Mike show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on""  
It's funny but don't laugh, money with no cash  
The real of the vocab, killin' is no path  
The realest to romat, don't even know half  
I'm rankin' a full tank you're runnin' on low gas

Take that, crack off your fund,  
You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim and none  
You can take it I have finished I have not begun  
  
Gotta razor blade tongue  
And I kid this done  
No wonder just dumpin' on your crew for fun  
Machine stop got it locked like the game's a joke  
Say summin' funny get the whole gang to vote  
Let 'em pucka now f-cka go get your own  
We've been roamed ten years since we did this note  
The people on the block start to get numb  
They expect it it's fresh when the new sh-t come  
It grows, let 'em know they can fix around  
Railroad, rap hot tracks one and you're down  
And they're askin' repeat how I do this now  
Like I'm really gonna tell 'em how I get this sound  
We just doin' what we do gettin' from that place  
We come in the back like we're on this b-tch  
Turn the lights down low when we start this show  
What, you two get me right back in the go  
  
[Hook]  
It's take that, take that, cuttin' if your fun  
You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim to none  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun  
  
Follow me I got styles you can chop me one  
Back in line I know you wanna stop me son  
But I got news for you f-cka that cannot be done  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun

Into winter now, bitter sweet  
Across that horizon this sun is setting down  
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go

Of every broken heart, digging through the wreckage  
Of your disregard, sinking down and waiting

Linkin Park,In The End,"It starts with one thing  
I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme  
To explain in due time  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away  
  
It's so unreal  
Didn't look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know  
Wasted it all just to watch you go  
I kept everything inside  
And even though I tried, it all fell apart  
What it meant to me  
Will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
One thing, I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how  
I tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Acting like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you fought with me  
I'm surprised it got so  
Things aren't the way they were before  
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then  
But it all comes back to me in the end  
You kept everything inside  
And even though I tried, it all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I've put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I can go  
For all this  
There's only one thing you should know  
I've put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I can go  
For all this  
There's only one thing you should know  
  
I tried so hard

Linkin Park,In Time,"Time, why must it fly so slow  
Waiting, is something that's easy for you  
Pull the plug, send it down the drain  
Pain is easy to get used to  
What's in me, is in you  
What's got me, has got you  
And everything told, must come true  
  
Pretending to be real, forgetting who you are  
Sin, is always at my door  
Slice the vein, blood spilled on the floor  
Light shining in my eyes  
Death greets me with a smile  
Pain  
So much pain  
Pain  
So much pain

Linkin Park,Iridescent,"When you were standing in the wake of devastation  
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown  
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now  
You were there impossibly alone.  
  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failure's all you've known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go, let it go.  
  
And in the burst of light that blinded every angel  
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars  
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space  
No one there to catch you in their arms  
  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failure's all you've known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go, let it go.

Watch them flee  
Watch them flee  
Rap up  
Watch them flee  
Hip-Hop hits  
And you do it like this  
  
It's going down  
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound  
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now  
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down  
The melting pot of a super-future X-style  
The combination of a vocal caress  
With lungs that gasp for breath  
From emotional stress  
With special effects  
And a distorted collage  
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

It's going down  
The logical progression on a the timeline  
The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly  
Take you on an audible odyssey

The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly

Composed sentences all together venomous  
The four elements of natural force  
Projected daily through the sound of the source  
Everybody on board with this blend  
The sword with the pen  
The mightiest is the weapons  
Swinging right from the chin  
The elevate of mental states  
Long gone with the wind  
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends  
It's going down  
Stalence emulation readily  
Trekking through the weaponry  
Of the pure pedigree  
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me  
Whatever the weather be  
We invent the steadily  
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high  
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots  
Execution of collaborative plots  
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

Linkin Park,Part Of Me,"Part of me won't go away  
Everyday reminded how much I hate it  
Weighted against the consequences  
Can't live without it, so it's senseless  
Wanna cut it out of my soul  
And just live with a gaping hole  
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste  
I made the problems in the first place  
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me  
You hardly see it right next to the heart of me  
Heard of me, the routine scar  
New cuts cover where the old ones are  
And now I'm sick of this  
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity  
I rather not even be then the man  
That's staring in the mirror through me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it  
Once it's been dealt with you feel like  
You've been touched by something angelic  
And then melted down into a pool of peace  
Cease to be the animal you used to be  
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong  
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone  
And then you start to see another piece  
Of yourself that you can't let be  
Memories of the last fight to free yourself  
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well  
And now you know that you can choose  
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise  
You can live if you're willing to  
Put a stop to just what's killing you  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
Alive in me, inside of me  
A part of me screams away silently  
Alive in me, inside of me  
A part of me screams away silently  
This part of me won't go away  
Part of me won't go away  
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be  
Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me  
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be  
Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me

Madonna,Living For Love,"[Verse 1]  
First you love me and I let you in  
Made me feel like I was born again  
You empowered me, you made me strong  
Built me up and I could do no wrong  
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms  
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms  
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark  
I was blind to your game  
You fired a shot at my heart

Took me to heaven, let me fall down  
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on  
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble  
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

Living for love, I'm living for love  
I'm not giving up

But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess  
I found freedom in the ugly truth  
I deserve the best and it's not you  
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down  
That have fallen apart, what was lost, now I'm found  
I picked up my crown, put it back on my head  
I can forgive, but I will never forget

All that you need  
Is right here with me

Wasn't for free

Would it put an end to all your doubt  
Frankly if my name was Benjamin

Madonna,More,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,  
Which was fine with me.  
Because I had rhythm, music, love,  
The sun, the stars and the moon above,  
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.  
That was when the best things in life were free.  
  
Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,  
Which is fine with me.  
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,  
But look at what I got to go with 'em.  
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.  
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.  
  
Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.  
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!  
  
Count your blessings, one, two, three  
I just hate keeping score.  
Any number is fine with me  
As long as it's more  
As long as it's more!  
  
I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition  
I find counting a bore.  
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.  
[More! More!]  
  
I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before  
Got my guy and my sky of blue,  
Now, however, I own the view.  
More is better than nothing, true  
But nothing's better than more, more, more  
Nothing's better than more.  
  
One is fun, why not two?  
And if you like two, you might as well have four,  
And if you like four, why not a few  
Why not a slew  
[More! More!]  
  
If you've got a little, why not a lot?  
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.  
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot  
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.  
[More! More!]  
  
Never say when, never stop at plenty,  
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.  
Happy with ten, happier with twenty  
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?  
  
Or does that sound too greedy?  
That's not greed, no, indeedy  
That's just stocking the store  
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.  
[More! More!]  
  
Each possession you possess  
Helps your spirits to soar.  
That's what's soothing about excess  
Never settle for something less.  
Something's better than nothing, yes!  
But nothing's better than more, more more  
[Except all, all, all]  
Except all, all, all  
Except once you have it all [have it all]  
You may find all else above [find all else above]  
That though things are bliss,  
There's one thing you miss, and that's  
More! More!  
More! More! More! More!  
More! More! More!

Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way

The reason that I live

Living in the shadows  
Walking only in night-time  
Outside

Sick and tired of this all

Michael Jackson,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene

Who will dance on the floor in the round  
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round  
  
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene  
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one  
Who will dance on the floor in the round  
  
People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts  
And mother always told me be careful of who you love  
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth  
  
Billie Jean is not my lover  
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one  
But the kid is not my son  
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son  
  
For forty days and forty nights  
The law was on her side  
But who can stand when she's in demand  
Her schemes and plans  
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round  
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice  
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)  
  
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me  
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)  
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby  
  
People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts  
She came and stood right by me  
Just the smell of sweet perfume  
This happened much too soon  
She called me to her room  
  
Billie Jean is not my lover  
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one  
But the kid is not my son

Till I had enough  
  
Mama, don't judge me now  
I'm not trying to hurt you  
I know this won't make you proud  
Papa, did I let you down?  
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?  
  
You'll see a monster  
I see a smile  
You say it's danger  
And I'm in denial  
But somehow I feel so safe right now  
  
So I guess I'm a fool  
I'm a fool in love  
But I'm willing to stay here  
And bask in the glory of his heart  
I guess I'm a fool in love  
But I'm willing to look so stupid  
Till I had enough

Rihanna,Four Evermore,"Is there another guy?  
Who I think is cool,  
Walking outside my door,  
Peeking everyday.  
  
I look at him,  
Like he is so poor,  
Everytime I eat he will steal,  
He is my boy.  
  
There are four Evermore,  
Radio stations,  
Everywhere that we go.  
You think I know,  
He is so cute.  
He is cool and funkin'.  
In the four Evermore.  
  
Is there someone?  
That I look onto,  
Kiss me on my cheek,  
Taking advantage.  
  
I look at him,  
Like he is so poor,  
Everytime I eat he will steal,  
He is my boy.

Even though it was a mistake,  
Telling me to walk out the door,  
And now you're wanting me back,

You say that you let her go  
Turn the page and closed the door  
Can't get inside your head  
'Cause when I try, she's there instead  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three

But I got to let you go 'cause this love is

That you've moved on

Invisible chains keep us in pain  
Won't you please tell her set you free?  
Sometimes when you look past me  
Your eyes see someone I can't see  
So I've given up this war

And I realize it's happenin'  
Baby, here I go again  
  
Here I go again  
  
Still remember how you make me weak  
How I fought to find the words to speak  
I just can't escape the memories  
I tried but I just can't break free  
But I closed the door on what we had  
But these feelings just keep comin' back  
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

But still remain the same  
Isn't life just a crazy game

So you know mi got fi swing  
That's why yuh request it again  
Without a doubt yuh want to spend  
And to experience it again  
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then  
So make me light it up again  
Reignite the flames again

Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril

Not to mention the way you are within

Something oh so true.

Rihanna,Love The Way You Lie Part 2,"On the first page of our story  
The future seemed so bright,  
Then this thing turned out so evil  
I don't know why I'm still surprised  
Even angels have their wicked schemes  
And you take that to new extremes  
But you'll always be my hero  
Even though you've lost your mind  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie.  
I love the way you lie  
Ohhh, I love the way you lie  
  
[Rihanna's Part 2]  
Now there's gravel in our voices  
Glass is shattered from the fight  
And this tug of war, you'll always win  
Even when I'm right.  
'Cause you feed me fables from your head  
With violent words and empty threats  
And it's sick that all these battles  
Are what keeps me satisfied  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie!  
Ohhh, I love the way you lie  
  
[Rihanna's Part 3]  
So maybe I'm a masochist  
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave  
Til the walls are goin' up  
In smoke with all our memories  
  
[Eminem's Part]  
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face  
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction  
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry  
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night  
So I can push you off me  
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me  
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy  
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me  
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me  
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the  
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we  
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs  
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky  
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,  
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?  
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count  
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain  
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'  
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand  
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it  
With you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!

Rihanna,Love The Way You Lie Remix,"Feat. Badboyz  
  
Chorus:  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie  
  
Boy:  
  
I'm going crazy, just another lie baby  
I don't know what to do with this hate and  
Every time I look in your eyes they're telling me lies and I don't know what
to do  
Only want the truth, but I  
Know that I will never get, the love that I had if knew what you were doing
wrong  
Cause this love never felt so strong, but at the same time it feels so weak oh  
  
You know that you're hurting me, baby can't you see  
That your love is all I need, that your love is all I feel  
But I wonder is it still that real  
And every time that I put a smile on my face  
It's because I don't wanna loose you,  
It's because I know it will kill you  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie  
  
J-Me:  
  
So I, open up my eyes, open up this healing, that I've been feeling  
Don't know where it's taking me, don't know if it's you or me oho  
So I, just cried a river of emotions deeper then the ocean  
Baby cause I know that I never wanna go  
Never wanna leave your side  
  
I love the way you lie when you do it,  
Makes me wanna puke and get sick of the things that you're making up  
And I'm so caught up in this love song,  
Do you really know what I long for  
I'm addicted to you, yes it is true  
Baby cause I want you to stay  
I hurt myself every day  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie

I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind  
I need to get out of sight, fore I end up behind bars  
  
What started out as a simple altercation  
Turned into a real sticky situation  
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing  
Makes me wanna cry  
  
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him  
Coulda been somebody's son  
And I took his heart when  
I pulled out that gun

Little 22, I call her Peggy Sue  
When she fits right down in my shoes  
Whatchu expect me to do? if you're playing me for a fool  
I will lose my cool, and reach for my fire arm  
  
I didn't mean to lay him down  
But its too late to turn back now  
Don't know what I was thinking  
Now he's no longer living  
So I'm bout to leave town, aye uh

Rihanna,Million Miles Away,"Here we lay face to face once again  
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend  
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know  
We're just holding on to ""could have been""s and we should be letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight  
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right  
And we both know that the story's ending  
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears  
Cause even though you're here  
It feels like you're a million miles away  
  
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?  
For what we were is like a season love is change  
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside  
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before  
While our song is playing its last note  
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door

Rihanna,Moon Is Blue,"When the light shines down  
And time goes slowly  
When my mind's in the dust  
Spoilt and dying  
  
There's a pain in my hand  
Inscribed to the sad and lonely  
I've been so cold and alone thinkin' how long  
  
Now if you had told me, she would come back  
And if you had told me, the clock was gonna fall  
If you had shown me, some affection  
I would have believed you  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue  
Cos tonight it's over, now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over  
  
And yeah you been bad  
So why did I still want you to hold me?  
My tears of broken glass thinkin' ho wlong  
  
The blade was a sharp one  
That cut me both ways and tore my world apart  
Now I could have healed that wound so deep  
But you wouldn't understand  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue,  
Cos tonight it's over, now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over  
  
Don't you know that you hurt me so? You!  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue, cos tonight it's over  
Now the pain's in the dust

I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at  
  
Got something that you need to know  
Either really should I never roll  
Cant hold it gotta let it go  
Though that I knew you'll never know  
  
Yea yea  
Listen babe  
  
Let me start by saying that  
The way I feel for you is never once changed  
And the games that we played, mistakes I made  
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know  
  
We got in problem babe I cant lie  
Cause lately I realize that I  
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)  
Knew that there was wrong but we (let it be)

That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho  
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do  
I know its hard for you  
Hard for you to live with him  
  
Trail memories from moments  
Treat love to be lonely  
Guess that's just the man in me  
Blaming onto liberty  
When the nights off feel like the right time  
And its spotlight feel like the white light  
But its really just my fears  
And still don't dry your tears,  
When I say she ain't true when I really love you more  
When you say if its true  
What you do it for and I  
I really don't know there's no excuse  
I break your heart make you cry  
I just wanna say goodbye

Its like poisons in my body  
And there's no way to deny  
That my heart is a time bomb  
With seconds left to explode  
But I gotta let you know before it blows  
  
That it ain't on you  
Its my fault  
All the gossip n' talkin'  
Behind your back when you walkin'  
By the time you will know  
Before long you'll see, that you deserve more  
You deserve more  
You deserve so much more

Break the beat down

It's that way she used to go  
  
When you want it nice and slow  
Even though you can't  
The memory will make you want some mo'  
She used to understand me  
  
Touch me, hold me, taught me how to be a man  
She used to kiss me all them things she used to show me  
Damn I wish that I could do it again

Somebody with a whole lot of body

Hot without the glam, not

Her life I submit to you is evidence  
I never been on bullshit  
She ain't caught me on no Tiger Woods shit  
Knew what I expected when she met me  
Should have left me then  
Balling against the law shorty go on arrest me then  
  
I guess I'm guilty for wantin' to be up in the club  
I guess in guilty cause girls always tryin' to show me love (hey)  
I guess I'm guilty for leavin' 'n' havin' a little fun  
Girl I'm guilty  
For that, girl I'm guilty  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail (take me)  
Don't take me to jail

Put money on my books  
Never mind forget it)

When she smiled at me  
She took my breath away  
She's reminiscent of a goddess  
It's a shame that we could not communicate  
How do I say  
  
How do I say hello?  
I just wanna talk to you  
How do I say you're beautiful  
When I can't take my eyes off you  
I don't wanna say the wrong thing  
I want just the right words to impress you  
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?  
  
How do I say?  
The room was filled with a sweet arom  
When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous  
She speaks with her body, so united  
In the language that I will never forget  
  
I hear her calling  
Spinning around in the crowd cause she found me  
And when she started moving closer and closer  
Does she know that i want her, I want her  
I wanna be with her tonight  
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips  
In my life, I've never felt like this  
I've never had a lost for words  
One kiss from her has got me feenin'  
  
How do I say hello?  
I just wanna talk to you  
How do I say you're beautiful  
When I can't take my eyes off you  
I don't wanna say the wrong thing  
I want just the right words to impress you

How do I say hello?  
I just wanna talk to you

If the first one is a nine, they a buck behind  
I live my rhyme, at the same time  
Can't find myself layin' up, if you ain't payin' up  
  
Bullets start sprayin' up, you know my niggaz is sick  
The game ain't enough for you to run up in this  
I need stacks of chips, you know dream house money  
Shit, you just like me  
So don't start actin' funny  
  
You're the kind of girl that makes  
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good, so damn good

So don't deny what you're about  
I know the truth and you know I do, I do, cuz

When no one else is there I bet you touch yourself  
Does it feel good?  
Late night calls, I bet you do it all  
Anything to get it off but you still persist to front on me  
Baby tell me  
  
Why do we play this game of chase  
When you know we both feel the same way  
And why do you put me through all these changes  
When you know you're just a freak like me (you're just like me)  
  
If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God  
It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster  
Voice yo' opinion, Queen B made a million  
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it  
  
When yo' head be in between it, if I had a penis  
I'd be heartless for real though, niggaz start shit  
I'd just flash out my dildo, ya'll move too quick  
Thought I'd be mesmorized by ya cocaine bricks  
  
And ya smoke gray six, nigga I thought you was a groupie  
Obsessed fan with my picture in ya hooptie-doo  
Heard my record now ya know I'm freaky  
So ya wanna wreck it and ya wanna see me

In a gun fight, two on three  
I'm next to pull, and I love life  
Something you never could imagine, then you woke the fuck up

I know sorries, just wouldn't do it  
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through  
But it's like moving mountains...  
It's like moving mountains... Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away  
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)  
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)  
Why just leave me?  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be, oh  
  
She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her  
We rarely even ever say a word  
I really want to give her everything she deserves  
But the bad took away the good  
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired  
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying  
You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say  
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it  
I should take it like a man and walk up out it  
Cause we will never be the same, oh  
I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame  
  
[Chorus]  
I know sorries just wouldn't do it  
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through  
Got to move this mountain  
It's like moving mountains... Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away  
It's like moving mountains... (moving)  
It's like moving mountains... (moving)  
Well baby why you just leave me?  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be, oh  
  
This must be a slow death that I'm travelin' on  
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin' on  
  
See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together (baby yea)  
  
And these hills that I'm travelin' up  
She ain't showin' me love  
I'm down on my love  
  
[Chorus]  
I know sorries just wouldn't do it  
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo  
But it's like moving mountains...  
It's like moving mountains... Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away  
It's like moving mountains...  
It's like moving mountains...  
Well baby why you just leave me?  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be, oh

Well is that really insanity  
Or just a losers' game

You better recognize what is real

To my life you give meaning that you're the best thing  
So precious like it for life

Right out of my prayer

It was supposed to be  
Just a one night  
In and out and I'm out the door  
But she's got me sitting here  
At the red light  
Driving round looking out for her  
  
Now its raining  
And I'm looking over at the passenger side  
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off  
She was stopping and dropping me  
Switching from fast to slow  
But that ain't have nothing on how you got  
When I got you home  
  
When you left (oh)  
I'm thinking which way did she go  
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall  
I'm in the wind on cruise control  
I'm searching for you cause I can't seem to let you go

You know  
I really only thought  
That this would be a one night stand  
What you doing to me

Maybe(maybe)  
She's running home to someone else(someone else)  
Or maybe(or maybe)  
She lost my number in her cell

Taunting and provoking, keep words unspoken  
Pandora?s box is open  
Blame brings pain, accusations seal these walls  
Walls built up to shield from pain  
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain  
And we need to stop  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver

Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it babe  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver  
(It goes around)  
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it babe  
Piercing, piercing with my actions, spitefully ignore you  
I don't even care just how much you take  
Bitten and it?s potent, you hate it and I know it

Look at there, there she is with some boy shorts on

Spinning what's left of it on the floor  
Have another round and just enjoy this party

You give her spending money  
Duh da duh da  
But all she want to spend is time alone (tonight)  
Keep givin' her  
The finer things but  
But she don't really need that  
If you don't stop you're  
You're gonna end up alone (alone)  
The world without love  
Why would you do it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Stop tryna buy her love  
cause you won't ever have enough  
There's always someone with more than you  
You need to pay her attention  
Give her what she needs  
Do the simple things  
Before you lose your girl to me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeeah  
Yeeeah yeah  
Play on playa  
Yeah  
Your girl comin' wit' me shorty, haha  
I'm tellin' you man  
cause you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You better look out  
I hear you talkin', I hear you talkin' (ha)  
But what are you saying  
Oh hoo oh hooo  
Don't be a fool  
You got a good thing  
Man are you blind  
Stupid or crazy?  
You got a good thing (uh)  
You got a good thing  
Special lady  
You better hold on  
And give her what she want  
Before she move on  
Man I tell you cars, clothes, and fancy things Don't mean a damn thing  
If you ain't kickin it, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't let this be the thing you'll always regret, no  
It's right there, it's right there

Usher,Slow Jam,"I was all alone  
I was feeling rather low  
I needed someone to lift my spirits up  
So I dropped in on a dance  
  
Just to take a glance  
And there this lovely thing was  
She was more than enough  
I asked her for her hand  
  
Said would you like to dance  
So pleased that I had asked  
She quickly took my hand  
And we danced and fell in love  
  
On a slow jam  
Ohh  
  
[Chorus]  
Play another slow jam  
This time make it sweet  
On a slow jam  
For my baby and for me  
Play another slow jam  
This time make it sweet  
On a slow jam  
For my baby and for me  
  
Seems what you say is true  
I feel the same way too  
You see I've waited all night long just to dance with you  
And when you touched my hand  
I knew you were the man  
  
To turn my world around  
And make my dreams come true  
The magic in your eyes, made me realize  
That everything I feel, has got to be real  
And we danced and fell in love  
On a slow jam  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm trying to find someone who  
I can give my good lovin' to  
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah  
  
Now I've been to find someone too  
I prayed to heaven, and then I found you  
I swear I fell in love the night you danced into my heart  
  
Play another slow jam  
This time make it sweet  
On a slow jam  
Can I get a slow jam  
Do you want to slow jam, baby  
Play another slow jam  
This time make it sweet  
Can I get a slow jam  
Play another slow jam  
Are you gonna slow jam

Jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags

Adele,Best For Last,"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?  
It's been there for days on end and  
It's been waiting for you to open up  
Yours too baby, come on now  
I'm trying to tell you just how  
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally  
Say that it's always been me  
  
[Chorus]  
That's made you feel the way you've never felt before  
And I'm all you need and that you never want more  
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue  
But you'd save the best for last  
Like I'm the one for you  
  
You should know that you're just a temporary fix  
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me  
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me  
  
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest  
It turns out it ain't enough  
You're still not mentioning love  
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?  
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere  
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her  
And I think that I know things may never change  
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say  
  
I make you feel the way you've never felt before  
And I'm all you need and that you never want more  
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue  
But you'd save the best for last  
Like I'm the one for you  
  
You should know that you're just a temporary fix  
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me  
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me  
  
But, despite the truth that I know  
I find it hard to let go and give up on you  
Seems I love the things you do  
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am  
To persist with this heartbreak and running around  
And I will do until I'm finding myself you  
  
And make you feel a way you've never felt before  
And be all you need so that you never want more  
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue  
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

Adele,Black And Gold,"The fish swam  
Out of the ocean  
And grew legs  
And they started walking  
And the apes climbed down  
From the trees  
And grew tall  
And they started talking  
  
And the stars  
Fell out of the sky  
And my tears  
Rolled into the ocean  
Now I'm looking  
For a reason why  
You even set my world  
Into motion  
  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then the stars  
Don't even matter  
Now I'm filled  
To the top with fear  
But it's all  
Just a bunch of matter  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then I don't want  
To be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
  
I looked up  
Into the grey sky  
And see a thousand eyes  
Staring back  
And all around  
These golden beacons  
I see nothing but black  
  
I feel a way of something  
Beyond them  
I don't see  
What I can feel  
If vision  
Is the only validation  
Then most of my life  
Isn't real  
  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then the stars  
Don't even matter  
Now I'm filled  
To the top with fear  
But it's all

Not one resemblance to the man I met  
Just a vacant broken boy instead

Bursting at the seams, no doubt  
We almost fall apart and burn to pieces  
So watch them turn to dust  
But nothing will never taint us  
  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?

Will he, will he still remember me?  
Will he still love me even when he's free  
Or will he go back to the place where  
He will choose the poison over me?  
When we spoke yesterday  
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait  
I'll be home soon, I won't be late  
  
He won't go  
He can't do it on his own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
He's willing to take the risk  
So I won't go, He can't do it on his own,  
If this ain't love, then what is?

Adele,Hiding My Heart,"This is how the story went  
I met someone by accident  
It blew me away  
It blew me away  
  
It was in the darkest of my days  
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain  
And buried them away, you buried them away  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
Drop you off at the train station  
Put a kiss on top of your head  
Watch you wave  
Watched you wave  
  
Then I went on home to your skyscrapers  
Neon lights and waiting papers  
That you call home  
I call it home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
I woke up feeling heavy hearted  
I'm going back to where I started  
The morning rain, the morning rain  
Although I wish that you were here  
That same old road that brought me here  
Is calling me home, It's calling me home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
And I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Adele,Take It All,"Didn't I give it all?  
Tried my best  
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less  
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?  
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round  
Still how can you walk away  
From all my tears  
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here  
But go on and take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love  
  
Maybe I should leave, to help you see  
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need  
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily  
I thought you loved me more than this  
  
But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love  
  
I will change if I must  
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust  
Oh if only, if only you knew  
Everything I do, is for you  
  
But go on and take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all, with my love  
Take it all with my love  
Take it all with my love

It had only just begun but now it's over now  
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold  
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold

Fell off your mind

Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Oy, I'm tired  
  
Where'd you go when you stayed behind  
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find  
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile  
I get closer you obviously prefer her

Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time

I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though

Adele,Water Under The Bridge,"[Verse 1]  
If you're not the one for me  
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?  
If you're not the one for me  
Why do I hate the idea of being free?  
And if I'm not the one for you  
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do  
Oh and if I'm not the one for you  
Why have we been through what we have been through?

You never seem to make it through the door

It ain't no life to live like you're on the run  
Have I ever asked for much?  
The only thing that I want is your love

Adele,When We Were Young,"[Verse 1]  
Everybody loves the things you do  
From the way you talk  
To the way you move  
Everybody here is watching you  
Cause you feel like home  
You're like a dream come true  
But if by chance you're here alone  
Can I have a moment  
Before I go?  
Cause I've been by myself all night long  
Hoping you're someone I used to know  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It looks like a movie  
It sounds like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me photograph you in this light  
In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was so scared to face my fears  
Nobody told me that you'd be here  
And I swore you moved overseas  
That's what you said when you left me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You still look like a movie  
You still sound like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young

My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Verse 3]  
It's hard to admit that  
Everything just takes me back  
To when you were there  
To when you were there  
And a part of me keeps holding on  
Just in case it hasn't gone  
I guess I still care  
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young

And find my glory in the power of the cross

For only by His grace I am redeemed  
And only His tender mercy  
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need  
And now I seek no greater honor  
Than just to know Him more  
And to count my gains  
But losses to the glory of my Lord

To land in the top ten slip in the top five  
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy  
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me  
Now a day I peep they intrests  
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed  
Money making brothers should take notes  
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat  
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a

My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up

Trying to fit that ass in.  
Took her half an hour just to get that...

I don't know where she's going and I do not plan on asking at all  
Cause her spirit is free,  
And she lets nobody else in except for me  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key  
Homie that's a guarantee

Don't forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in,  
Kinda' hard to concentrate when cameras are flashing.  
Other dudes will suffocate her, I don't want her gaspin,  
Don't know where she's going, and I do not plan on asking at all  
I've never been the type felt a like my connection  
With niggas that wanna fight over women, that's not right,  
There's too many in the world, homie you could have yo pick

Drake,Back To Back,"[Intro]  
Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again  
  
[Verse]  
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley  
You can never check me  
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message  
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon  
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97  
Whoa, very important and very pretentious  
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention  
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience  
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options  
I wanna see my niggas go insane  
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame  
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne  
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way  
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?  
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB  
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad  
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap  
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up  
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs  
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough  
They just mad cause I got the midas touch  
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her  
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?  
I know that you gotta be a thug for her  
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more  
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers  
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga  
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas  
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wife-in niggas  
Make sure you hit him with the prenup  
Then tell that man to ease up  
I did another one, I did another one  
You still ain't did shit about the other one  
I got the drink in me goin' back to back  
Yeah, goin' back to back  
I got the drink in me goin' back to back  
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back  
I don't wanna hear about this ever again  
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends  
Not even when you sayin', ""Drizzy, tell 'em again""  
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event  
Oh, you need better seatin'  
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason  
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em  
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom  
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece  
Please, please do not let these niggas near me  
Please, think before you come for the great one  
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?  
Please, somebody stop me  
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy  
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit  
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'  
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back  
Yeah, they want it back to back  
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back  
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga

Drake,Fireworks,"Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go  
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow  
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below  
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago  
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t  
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it  
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it  
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit  
Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with  
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it  
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with  
I hope that my success never alters our relationship  
Yeah, this life is something I would die for  
Octobers Own, but its lookin' like July 4th  
I just wish they'd let you try it first  
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me  
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery  
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me  
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me  
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily  
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me  
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me  
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me  
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby  
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious  
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it  
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though  
You never see it coming you just get to see it go  
Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first  
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks!  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
Everything the same but it feels different  
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen  
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'  
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it  
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport  
Got my mother in a place with some better decor  
She searched the entire city I let her explore  
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before  
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?  
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted  
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic  
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?  
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts  
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close  
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first  
That's why I'm really going off, Fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks

I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us  
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect  
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left

Ed Sheeran,Candle In The Wind,"Goodbye Norma Jean  
Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
They crawled out of the woodwork  
And they whispered into your brain  
They set you on the treadmill  
And they made you change your name  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Loneliness was tough  
The toughest role you ever played  
Hollywood created a superstar  
And pain was the price you paid  
Even when you died  
Oh the press still hounded you  
All the papers had to say  
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  
  
Goodbye Norma Jean  
From the young man in the 22nd row  
Who sees you as something as more than sexual  
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And you can stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
I'll wake with coffee in the morning  
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea  
Outside the day is up and calling  
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep  
  
Stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now

Ed Sheeran,Don't,"Ah lahmlahlah  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I met this girl late last year  
She said don't you worry if I disappear  
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake  
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait  
But then I jump right in  
A week later returned  
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn  
But I gave her my time for two or three nights  
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right  
I went away for months until our paths crossed again  
She told me I was never looking for a friend  
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10  
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin  
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late am  
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said  
She's singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 2:]  
For a couple weeks I  
Only want to see her  
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza  
Before a text message was the only way to reach her  
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her  
Singing out Aretha  
All over the track like a feature  
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either  
But me and her we make money the same way  
Four cities, two planes the same day  
Those shows have never been what it's about  
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out  
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch  
But we should get on a plane  
Or we'll be missing it now  
Wish I'd have written it down  
The way that things played out  
When she was kissing him  
How? I was confused about  
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 3:]  
[Knock knock] on my hotel door  
I don't even know if she knows what for  
She was crying on my shoulder  
I already told ya  
Trust and respect is what we do this for  
I never intended to be next  
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all  
And I never saw him as a threat  
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course  
It's not like we were both on tour  
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor  
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment  
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different  
This is not the way you realize what you wanted  
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest  
All this time God knows I'm singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus 2x:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah

Ed Sheeran,Drunk,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up  
On the right side of the wrong bed  
And never in a excuse I made up  
Tell you the truth I hate  
What didn't kill me  
It never made me stronger at all.  
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me  
So now I'll maybe leave back there  
I'm sat here wishing I was sober  
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.  
  
But the house gets cold when you cut the heating  
Without you to hold I'll be freezing  
Can't rely on my heart to beating  
'Cause you take part of it every evening  
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing  
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love  
  
I wanna hold your heart in both hands  
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can  
And I've got no plans for the weekend  
So shall we speak then  
Keep it between friends  
No, I know you'll never love me like you used to.  
  
But may be other people like us  
Who see the flicker of the clip when they light up  
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before  
You don't hold me anymore.  
  
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name  
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake  
You know I can't change as I began saying  
You cut me wide open like landscape  
Open bottles of beer but never champagne  
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.  
  
All by myself  
I'm here again  
All by myself  
You know I'll never change  
All by myself  
All by myself  
I'm just drunk, again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.

Ed Sheeran,Everything Has Changed,"[Taylor Swift]  
I use to think that love was for dreamers,  
""Love at first sight"" I never believed it,  
Had my head on tight, I lived in the real world,  
But that was until I met you.  
Now everything is changed.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Yesterday I was drinking my sorrows away,  
On the edge of forever storing my heart away,  
On the verge of letting my heart go stray.  
And that's when I met you.  
And now everything is changed.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Oh darling,  
You look like your soul is lost.  
What could've happened to make you feel so low?  
Don't let the liquor ease your hurt.  
Don't let your heart go cold.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Oh darling,  
Don't worry, I'll be just fine.  
What's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?  
If I weren't drinking then I'd be crying,  
And I think that's something we both rather miss.  
  
[Both]  
But I guess that's just how the cookie crumbles,  
You give your all and watch as your heart tumbles  
Down and down until you can't feel anymore.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
That's the thing about love,  
That's the reason why I'll never fall again,  
It hurts when it's supposed to make you make you feel good.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Well if that's what love is,  
Then I don't ever wanna try it out,  
But something tells me I should.  
  
Even though we've only met each other,  
We'll work it out together until everything is changed.  
Until everything is good.

But this place'll stay the same  
And I'll know

And I pack another knapsack  
The airport's like a stop light to me  
Sittin' on red, green light go  
Can't see my family  
My family grew into a global trance  
Or fans, some may call 'em  
And it's on the stage I stand  
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream  
I lived the life, signed a picture  
'Cause no dam could stop the stream  
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades  
And a pocket fulla culture condoms  
They put you on the podium for first place  
But on the block, they judge you on 'em  
So  
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?  
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth  
Put the hood in mossy oak  
I'm the  
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life  
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write  
With a broken pen, there they go again  
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam  
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in  
I'm goin' home, I'm home again  
Bring it back up in the UK  
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack  
Catfish Billy, hell, you say  
I'm just bein' blunt, homie  
Keep the grass  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly  
  
Yeah, take one look  
Better yet, take two  
But if I take that break, there's a move you made  
This dude you shape will come take you back  
Back to the roots I've been  
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in  
Or a spot to sleep in  
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season  
'Cause I am not the reason  
That the image you're used to seein'  
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless  
Meaning yes, I'm different  
Differently made  
And me screamin' the A  
Is not the difference in grades  
It's the place I stayed  
'Cause the schools were underpaid  
The teachers taught, but to me they fought  
A star that was underway  
It was under Wayne, it was in my name  
Michael  
M.W.A  
Atha  
And in trouble I stayed  
Breakin' out of this bubble they made  
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven  
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet  
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand  
Committed to the words I say  
A blood line's not a family tree  
It's a needle in my skin for all to see  
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk  
But I drink and take the ink  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly

This car keeps on stalling,  
Pedal to the floor  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know is if you want me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We were young and we were foolish  
Schoolbooks in our arms  
Dodging homework, dodging classes  
To set off fire alarms  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away

And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call

Ed Sheeran,Firefly,"I fell in love next to you  
Burning fires in this room  
It just fits, light and smooth  
Like my feet in my shoes  
Little one, lie with me  
Sew you heart to my sleeve  
We'll stay quiet underneath  
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
Teach my skin those new tricks  
Warm me up with your lips  
Heart to heart, melt me down  
It's too cold in this town  
Close your eyes, lean on me  
Face to mouth, lips to cheek  
Feeling numb in my feet  
You're the one  
To help me get to sleep  
  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down

Ed Sheeran,Give Me Love,"Give me love like her,  
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone,  
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,  
Told you I'd let them go,  
And that I'll fight my corner,  
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,  
After my blood turns into alcohol,  
No, I just wanna hold ya.  
  
Give a little time to me or burn this out,  
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,  
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,

And it's been a while but I still feel the same,

And that tonight I'll call ya,

I've spent it in good company  
And all the harm that e'er I've done  
Alas it was to none but me  
And all I've done for want of width  
To memory now I can't recall  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
Of all the comrades that ever I had  
They are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that ever I had  
They would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
A man may drink and not be drunk  
A man may fight and not be slain  
A man may court a pretty girl  
And perhaps be welcomed back again  
But since it has so ought to be  
By a time to rise and a time to fall  
Come fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Good night and joy be with you all

Ed Sheeran,Gold Rush,"Smoke alarm went off at night  
I woke up wiped the sleep out of my eye  
She left a note, I'll be back in five  
Well I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive  
  
Hey!  
  
I was told to put my job in front of you,  
But it won't hold me like you do  
  
But I do it for the love,  
Waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge  
Smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved  
  
I never told her that I liked  
The way she dances slightly out of time  
And pretends she knows the words, to a song she's never heard  
But I tell her all the time

This drink is a liver killer,  
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again,  
Your body is my ballpoint pen  
  
And your mind is my new best friend,

Eminem,Lose Yourself,"Look,  
If you had  
One shot,  
Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip?  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti  
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'  
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out  
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now  
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!  
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity  
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked  
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No  
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes  
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke  
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's
when its  
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment  
You own it, you better never let it go  
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order  
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar  
It only grows harder, only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher  
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to  
Five and I can't provide the right type of  
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers  
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna,  
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not  
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's
lot  
So here I go is my shot.  
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Eminem,Loser,"A distant alarm, a sound from far away  
We raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see  
The restless crowd is now breaking the silence  
Anxiety is rising, the sky is turning dark  
A riot is emerging, men beat men to death  
This is unexplainable, a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker:  
""This is not a drill, I repeat: this is not a drill...""  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving, turning people into beasts  
They're feasting on eachother, strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins, society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind, nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open, dust is descending  
Breath the black air, feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence - nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear, the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
A distant early warning  
A sound from far away  
We raised our heads  
Towards the sky  
Towards the alarm...

Eminem,Love Me,"[Obie Trice]  
You don't see me in the hood, it's cause I'm doing this man  
  
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens  
I'm still getting chased by those lights  
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on  
And my time is none, because I'm writing more  
I don't hear to meet a soul in this business  
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this  
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man  
I got Young Kobe homey, you gotta let go of Obie  
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on  
And that yak going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from town  
It's forever, put that on the cheddar, man  
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time  
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out  
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about  
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to love, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)  
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you thorough the night  
(Right we want to love alcohol, we want to love guns, we want to love money  
we don't love no bitches, though)  
I just want to love, for the rest of my life  
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you in the night

There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice  
Cause it's sort of unique 'cause you know it's me

You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep  
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap  
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped  
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically  
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money  
You can't pay me enough for you to play me  
It's cockamamie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady  
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo  
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal  
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it, there's no more humor in it, you
know  
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag  
You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch  
  
[Chorus]

My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name  
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain  
If I was you, I'd love men too, I roll like a boss  
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce  
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit  
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch  
Niggas eating popcorn, right, rewinding the tape  
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape  
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's  
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose  
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet  
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats  
That nigga D'Angelo, he determined not to fail  
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell  
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes  
And Big Ben taught Charlie B 'More to deep throat (yea)

Eminem,Love The Way You Lie,"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
I can't tell you what it really is  
I can only tell you what it feels like  
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe  
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight  
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight  
High off of love drunk from my hate  
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer  
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown  
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,  
And I love it, wait  
Where you going, I'm leaving you  
No you ain't, come back  
We're running right back, here we go again  
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great  
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane  
But when it's bad, it's awful  
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude  
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her  
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
You ever love somebody so much  
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet  
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,  
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em  
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em  
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,  
Now you're in each others face,  
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em  
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,  
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em  
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both  
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,  
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday  
Yesterday is over, it's a different day  
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her  
Next time you'll show restraint  
You don't get another chance,  
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again  
Now you get to watch her leave,  
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
Now I know we said things, did things  
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns  
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is  
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded  
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,  
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems  
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano  
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now  
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,  
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball  
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall  
Next time, there will be no next time  
I apologize even though I know it's lies  
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar  
If she ever tries to fucking leave again  
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie

Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly  
  
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation  
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation  
When you step away son, she got her face done  
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if  
  
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you  
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice  
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency  
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee  
  
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it  
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!)

You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down  
  
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this  
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be  
You say you want to be with me, but how can you say that  
When you got niggas hiding in your closet  
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely  
  
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me  
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies  
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas  
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number  
  
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..  
Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga  
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands  
And said ""Oh it's like that?""  
  
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit  
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit  
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number  
She asked could I give her mine too  
  
Got to the crib and called her up  
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck  
I said ""Maxine check this out,  
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""  
  
Got to the crib she let me in  
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom  
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things.  
What the fuck are you doing?""  
  
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing  
As she went for my midsection  
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt  
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work  
  
Before I hit it she said  
""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass""  
I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok""  
She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS""  
I got up out  
  
Hey, Maxine  
What  
You thinking about sucking my dick?  
Yeah for a small price  
  
For a small price? What you mean?  
You know, money nigga  
You don't need no damn money,  
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.  
  
What you, what you hear I got?  
AIDS  
Who told you that bullshit?  
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie  
  
Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then  
Oh for real, it's like that?  
Well I ain't got shit,  
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,  
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga  
  
Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you  
No, see..  
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you  
Hold on, why it ain't even like that  
  
I want ya'll to get paid, fucking

Monkey see monkey do  
Don't ever make the first move  
Just let em' come to you  
Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do  
So let em' come to you  
The rest of us follow suit  
Monkey see monkey do  
Tweedle-de-tweedle-dumb  
If they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come  
Now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up  
Check-mate motherfucker  
Games over  
We won  
Tweedle-de-tweedle-dumb  
  
It doesn't take much  
For me to raise such a stink up  
When motherfuckers hate your guts  
You ain't even gotta say much  
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers  
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush  
I can't explain what it is my brain does  
But however it works its insane  
Its plain nutz  
And it ain't just my brain thas dangerous  
Its a whole combination of things  
It takes nutz  
And I'm not affriad to raise the stakes up  
I got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks  
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us  
I'm patiently waiting for the day  
I'm anxious  
To see the look on ya fake mugs  
When you thugs go bankrupt  
Ya drunk  
Ya ain't tough  
Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas  
This is me talking motherfucker  
This ain't drugs  
You wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up  
FUCK THAT  
Its too late chump now face up  
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay
does  
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off  
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off  
So I can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw  
And give him the surgery that he came for  
Till I pull the paint off  
I never been shot  
But I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth  
Cause I've always came off  
Like ja's chain  
When they try to rush him and lost  
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it  
I don't stop  
The only thing I wait for  
Is day that I don't gotta report to probate court  
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more  
Cause I've been holding my tongue till I got a sprained jaw  
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain't ja  
And ima read that motherfucker off from April  
You pussies think I went soft since 8 mile  
When I come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls  
Trust me

Eminem,Murder Murder,"[Chorus: x2]  
""All I see is blood and murder, my mind state""  
""Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate""  
""All I see is blood and murder, my mind state""  
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!  
  
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand  
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman  
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands  
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span  
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'  
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'  
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
'Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin' the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' ""Freeze!""  
But I'm already wanted for sellin' Ki's  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots, they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out  
We were backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out  
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin' mouth,  
'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up  
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up  
Stole her car, made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on ""Set it Off"" did  
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal  
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though  
Parents screamin', ""Son, go in and call the police  
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin' ""truce truce!""  
(Don't shoot!) Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasn't me!  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps

Eminem,Music Box,"Yo, yeah girl,  
Can you hear that? It's playing our song  
Are you sleepy? Take a nap  
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?  
  
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep  
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep  
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat  
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street  
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham  
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam  
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey  
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am  
  
[Chorus]  
(My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)  
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)  
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)  
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)  
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)  
  
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross  
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose  
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose  
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know  
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around  
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds  
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out  
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out  
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?  
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house  
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box  
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked  
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts  
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts  
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark  
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's  
Neck like a pixie stick  
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,  
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in  
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'  
The mortician of love, sent from above,  
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become  
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb  
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns  
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder  
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her  
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her  
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her  
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha  
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya  
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula  
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her  
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her  
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera  
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto  
Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso  
Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so  
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones  
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know  
You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)  
This is niether the time or the place to get macho  
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos  
Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow

Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke

Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill  
You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to
feel  
Like I don't think anyone's real,  
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step
beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer  
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,  
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row,  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,  
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in,  
And how they attacked the victim,  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,  
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,  
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes

When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like  
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light  
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way  
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?  
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms  
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,  
He can give her some, she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises  
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes  
You stare into your stereos eyes  
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,

To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?  
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls, I cut'em off,  
And got'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall  
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall,

So tell Laura and her husband to back off

And have pussy lips glued to my face  
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows  
Quit givin' me my ammo. Can't you see why I'm so mean?  
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.

Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme  
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work,  
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first  
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,  
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue  
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once  
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son  
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,  
And kicked and hit with shit every time  
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on.  
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl  
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,  
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade  
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids
love it.  
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers  
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

And met a new wave blond babe with half of her head shaved  
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up  
With first aid tape and raped on the first date  
Susan an ex heroin addict who just stopped using  
She loved booze and alternative music  
Told me she was going back to using again  
I said wait first try this hallucinogen  
Its better then heroin and booze and gin  
Come here lets go in here  
Who's in the den? (Its me and Kelly)  
My bad lets try another room (I don't trust you)  
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom  
This will help you get in touch with your roots  
Walking barefoot butt naked and run in the woods

Oh dag I didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag (Uh)

I just wanted to make you appreciate nature  
Susie stop crying I don't hate ya  
The world is not against you

So you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth  
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out

I said I am high too bitch  
Quit grabbing my t-shirt (Let go)  
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me

Kids and I can't cook)  
I am over here Sue  
You are talking to the plant  
Look we need to get to a hospital  
Before it is too late  
'Cause I never seen one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate

Susie where you going you better be careful  
(leave me alone dad I am sick of getting my hair pulled)  
I am not your dad  
And try not to swallow your tongue  
Want some gum?  
Put down the scissors before you do something dumb  
I will be right back just chill baby please?  
I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these  
John where's Dave at before I bash you  
He's in the bathroom  
I think he is taking a crap dude  
Dave pull up your pants  
We need an ambulance  
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants  
Chopping her hair off  
And there's only two days left of spring break  
How long do these things take to wear off?  
Well it depends on how may you've had

Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls  
Drinking Lysol (She is going to die dude)

But I know this shit got loud and I heard rumbling from struggling  
And rolling on the ground  
Could never get used to that sound  
My mama saying get off me  
My tears is tumbling now  
I wish that you never saw me  
'Cuz I, felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12  
I wish I would'be bust through that door my fucking self  
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf  
If nothing else scared a nigga shitless  
There goes two of my wishes  
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart  
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are  
Fast-forward to our older years  
Two different paths  
You used to talk to me about college but that shit didn't last  
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?  
So tired of not having things, you never see it my way  
Too proud to fold  
You're demise  
One day to my surprise, my nigga called me, told me you just caught a body
twice your size  
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride  
And that they trying to give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five damn  
Not my nigga  
The same one that told me that things always get better  
Just trust me, don't cry my nigga  
The news call him a killa, but he my nigga  
Sad shit  
Ay yo genie last wish, free my nigga

J Cole,A Tale Of 2 Citiez,"Look at me my nigga  
Fantasize about a white picket fence  
With some trees my nigga  
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints  
that's all I need my nigga  
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched  
But now I see my nigga  
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since  
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced  
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps  
Fuck being timid in the Civic  
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps  
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?  
Yeah can I get a glimpse?  
  
Last night I had a bad dream  
That I was trapped in this city  
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?  
They robbin' niggas on the daily  
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things  
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like  
Uh, nice watch, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air  
  
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams  
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold  
I know the shits not always good as it seems  
But tell me till you get it how could you know  
How could you know? How could you know?  
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich  
Fuck with me my nigga  
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick  
Cop some tree my nigga  
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip  
You gon' see my nigga  
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick  
And that's the key my nigga  
And listen up I'm bout to go and get rich  
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga  
Me I want my pockets fat about a bitch  
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga  
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic  
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga  
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?  
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

I look outside and all the clouds are gray  
I need your hands to take me, miles away  
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but  
Before you go I've got to, want you now  
Whatever goes up surely, must come down  
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found  
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man

All in her sheets left for a week  
What she do, double back  
Now I know we far from perfect  
But I feel like this is perfect, do you disagree with that  
If not than holla back  
Hey and tell ya girl you'll call her back

My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone  
Telling how man dogging me

Cause she aint showing me no sympathy

Home a long time ago

Now, now, now, know we be arguing  
But aint you riding with me  
We breaking up we making up  
Like Dwayne Wayne, and Whitney  
You throw things, you broke things  
Use both hands and hit me  
And right when you call the law  
I'll tell my boy to come get me  
Then you, than you start listening  
To friends, and then it, gets tricky  
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky  
So you ignore the hickys, the pics of chicks and they vicky's  
That they sent me, is that real love  
You're the only one that I will love  
Damn, damn  
  
My Best friends say  
I could stay with her  
At her house, no doubt anytime I like  
My best friends say  
Don't let you in my life, cause you don't do for me  
And you don't act right  
My best friends say  
If she was me, she'll let you go along time ago  
My best friends say, my best friends say  
  
I'll still be there for you

How you feeling, let me know what's on your mind  
We've been together for a long long time

Round, round, round

J Cole,Blowin Smoke,"[Verse:]  
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close  
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever  
Never, Rozay rich forever  
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever  
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight  
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked  
And just from life, knocking you on your ass  
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass  
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it  
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water  
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys  
Back in the days, I would've hated on the new boys  
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing  
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along  
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went  
A couple singles but could never be the main event  
Without substance, something for them to grab on  
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long  
I ain't even certain, one day they love you  
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you  
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you  
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you  
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train  
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane  
I pray to god end they reign  
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about  
And could've died when I came from disbelief  
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak  
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks  
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime  
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?  
  
[Outro:]  
Nah mean, nah mean?  
That was like a Jay Z drink  
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?  
You know how I used to say it  
Nah mean?

East side, West side, worldwide, ride out  
  
Now I ain't got no kids yet,  
But this right here's for practice  
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet,  
But that's how good your ass is  
Make an old man get his glasses,  
Make Wesley pay his taxes  
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter,  
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider  
You now rocking with the best man,  
Dress game down to the sex game  
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed mane,  
Let you play with the stick, Ovechkin  
She calling, she texting,  
She's falling, but let me explain  
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl  
Cause a nigga don't play them ex games  
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting  
And I ain't coming offa my last name  
Cause I really can't take no stressing  
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit,  
Your home girl saying, ""He a bad boy""  
But I'm signed to the Roc,  
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids  
  
[Chorus]  
She said, ""I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes  
You be up to no good and everybody knows  
My home girls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know  
But what you got, I need a lot so I can't let you go""  
She said, ""I, can't get enough, can't get enough"" (I need that)  
""I, can't get enough, can't get enough"" (I need that)  
""I can't get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot  
Tried to let go but I just could not, so don't you stop, I need that""  
  
Hey, Globetrotter,  
Cole hotter even way out in London town  
Hoes holla 'cause they love my sound  
And I got love for the underground  
Kwali, Pimp C, H-town where Bun get down  
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night,  
That'll suck all night, you just cut off lights  
Almost missed my flight,  
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?  
She be down for whatever,  
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?  
Never fuss or fight,  
On the grind tryna find this lettuce  
I love it when you give me head,  
I hate it when you give me headaches  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothing sunny  
I see 'em hating, but it ain't nothing to me  
I'm from the Ville, where they bang for the money  
And carry fo' fives like change for a twenty  
So what I look like scurred?  
Them niggas over there look like nerds  
Never mind that girl, let's make a track  
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr  
That's the hook, right thurr  
There's the hook, right thurr  
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track  
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr

My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds  
My main chick she got real hair, ain't never got to go shop for hers  
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat but goddamn she rocking them furs  
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna find me, now the ho wanna climb me  
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me  
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching oops nigga  
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga

In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you

Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no bucket  
Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ay  
She think I'm in the nba, why a nigga can't have his mba?  
Next time I'mma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon shock her  
""You so tall what team do u play for?"" No bitch I'm a doctor  
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah  
Float like a propeller no helicopter shit  
Not stick like a bowlegged chick  
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar  
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber

Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up

I'm like ""Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound""  
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do  
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin re-coupe  
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date  
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste  
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage  
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin on gas, full service  
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit  
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense

Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit

See I could probably, rush you  
Tell you that he should have loved you  
Take advantage, fuck you  
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do  
But the truth is, we all the same  
On different teams, but it's all a game  
The objective, tryna score  
You got a wife, you find a whore  
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants, you find the door  
You drive her home, she mop you off  
You bust again, and drop her off  
Then repeat like an episode  
Why we cheat? I'll never know  
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no  
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow  
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe  
Could it be cause my father let me know  
That he cheated, and somehow I never told  
I never told

Alright then man. You're a man now.  
Okay.""  
  
OK, that's what it is, I see the game  
The hoes come, the seasons change  
The hoes go, we rearrange  
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same

Forever young, Peter Pan  
Thirty five, still playin', child support, still payin'  
Jugglin', bill payin'  
Been runnin' round, field dayin'  
Wine and dine, meal payin'  
With hopes that she'll land  
The bed and, get wet then, give head then  
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man  
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man  
One night stands, no best man  
No bridesmaids, or reverends  
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man  
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts  
There go the sparks and broken hearts  
Who wanna build Noah's Ark  
Just to have that shit torn apart  
  
""You know what? I need to talk to you.  
About what?

These other niggas can't adapt because they not as clever  
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better  
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter  
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather  
And, so sick they can't fix this with medi-cine  
We at yo door and she gotta let us in

Shame you feel you have to bite  
Still aint nobody snapping right  
Pedal to the metal as I'm speeding through the traffic lights

Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in
Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.  
If you fool me we can't get fooled again  
  
Fool me one time shame on you  
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you  
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs  
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet  
My only regret was too young for Nia Long  
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows  
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along  
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu  
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home  
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone  
With the stale face cause they know it's they song

[Hook:]  
I tried, you tried, we tried  
All of the times that we had together  
We should of known nothing last forever(X2)  
  
[Verse 1: J. Cole]  
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly  
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me  
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me  
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me  
Soon as this shit end, forget about it  
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it  
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it  
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it  
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'  
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?  
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass  
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama  
On my mama, we been through it all  
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall  
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst  
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 2: J. Cole]  
They say we won't last  
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask  
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell  
A good nigga gone bad  
Good chick a lil mad as fuck, she done had enough  
I be, out here tryna raise my status up  
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck  
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist  
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste  
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you  
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you  
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, you ain't about nothin'  
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you  
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start  
But deep down you know we grew apart  
Long before I broke your heart, if I lost your respect  
I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been awhile  
Apologies, I ain't been around  
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now  
And times have changed  
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?  
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it  
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it  
Now we can say that all good things come to an end  
But we know each other way too well to pretend  
We went from friends to somethin' much more  
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more  
Second chances, we gave enough to finally  
We gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more  
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather  
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better  
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me  
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories

How we stop the black panthers?  
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer  
You hear that?  
What Gil Scott was hearing  
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin  
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland  
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch  
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since  
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it  
The fiends cop it  
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit  
We ain't sure man  
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man

From the place where the fathers gone  
The mothers is hardly home  
And the  
Gonna lock us up in a, home  
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes  
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam  
Who gave Saddam anthrax?  
George Bush got the answers  
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical  
Am and Hammer baking soda  
Raised they own quota  
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause  
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman  
Ta being a president look there's hope man  
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man  
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing  
And this is the soundtrack  
This the type of music you make when you round that  
Crack music nigga

See I done did all this ole bullshit  
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit  
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies  
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy

Your promise for my ring

Michael Jackson,Jam,"Nation to nation, all the world must come together,  
Face the problems that we see,  
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.  
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later.  
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?  
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.  
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?  
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,  
But we must live each day like it's the last.  
Go with it, go with it.

It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.  
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,  
It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to  
  
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,  
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.  
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,  
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.  
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.  
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?  
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,  
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself.  
Go with it, go with it.

Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.  
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a

Lift up your head and show the world you got pride  
Go for what you want, don't let 'em get in your way  
You can be a winner,  
But you got to keep the faith  
Gon' keep it brother  
You got it  
I know that keepin' the faith  
Means never givin' up on love  
But the power that love has  
To make it right  
Makes it  
Makes it right  
  
Keep the faith  
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother  
You got to know when it's good to go  
To get your dreams up off the ground  
Keep the faith  
Baby, yea  
Because it's just a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out  
  
Better stand up and act like you wanna do right  
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life  
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday  
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith  
Look at yourself and what you're doin' right now  
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out  
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day  
Get yourself together, 'cause you got to keep the faith  
Uh, uh, uh  
  
Don't let nobody take you down, brother  
Just keep your eyes on the prize  
And your feet flat on the ground  
Keep the faith, baby, yea  
Because it's just a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out  
Lift up your mind  
Before your mind gets blown  
Some things in life you best just leave them alone  
Go for what you want  
Don't let it get in your way  
You can make it happen  
But ya got ta keep the faith  
  
Gon' keep it brother  
You got to keep the faith  
Yeah keep the faith  
Gon' keep it sister  
You got to keep the faith now, now

How to do the thing right  
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride  
Go for what you want  
Don't let 'em get in your way  
You can be a winner if you keep the faith  
  
Straighten out yourself and get your mind on track  
Dust off your butt and get your self-respect back  
You've known me long enough to know that I don't play  
Take it like you want it but you got to keep the faith  
Gon'  
  
Don't let nobody take you down  
Just keep your eyes on the prize  
And get your feet back on the ground  
Keep the faith, baby, yea  
Because it's lust a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out  
  
But till that day  
I said you've got to keep the faith!

Michael Jackson,Keep Your Head Up,"She's lookin' for a job and a finer place to stay,

She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive,  
She works in a restaurant, night and day  
She waits her life away  
She wipes the tears away  
  
She cries inside every time she feels this way,  
And she's dying inside every time her baby cries, no

Against my window pane  
And wonder if you  
Are watchin' snowflakes too  
I take a walk downtown  
To where you used to meet me  
There's joy everywhere  
But all that waiting there is  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me  
No one seems to care  
They just went away and left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas Eve  
  
I hear the Christmas bells  
(Bum Bum Bum)  
The happy people singing  
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears  
I sadly close my eyes  
And say a little bear(?)  
You'll be waiting there for me  
I look but all I see is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the season of love  
(This is the season of love)  
But I'm as sad as I can be

Why did you have to leave me

Michael Jackson,Love's Gone Bad,"Ah I feel a fountain in my brain  
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain  
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears  
Heart so sad 'cause love's gone bad  
  
I see a rainbow all in black  
Must be a sign that you ain't comin' back  
Wake up at night callin' your name  
I see a face on my window pane  
  
I've been this way since you've been gone  
Without your love I can't go on  
Look in the mirror, what do I see?  
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me  
Now where's the love you promised me?  
Where's he tenderness to comfort me?  
  
Everytime some love I choose  
I seem to always be the one to lose  
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears  
Heart fells sad 'cause love's gone bad  
Love's gone bad, heart fells bad  
  
Black crows flying up above  
It's a sign that I live life without love  
Slime's on the man, slime's ont the sea  
Slime's everywhere I said I'm destined to be  
  
And this world where nothing's right  
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night  
You said you'd be true to me  
Instead you made a fool out of me  
Heart feels sad, love's gone bad

For once in my life  
It's gonna feel real good  
Gonna make a difference  
Gonna make it right  
  
As I, turn up the collar on  
My favorite winter coat  
This wind is blowing my mind  
I see the kids in the streets  
With not enough to eat  
Who am I to be blind?  
Pretending not to see their needs  
  
A summer disregard, a broken bottle top  
And a one man soul  
They follow each other on the wind ya' know  
'Cause they got nowhere to go  
That's why I want you to know  
  
I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change  
  
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love  
It's time that I realize  
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan  
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?  
  
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart  
And a washed-out dream  
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see  
'Cause they got no place to be  
That's why I'm starting with me

And I don't got no patience, no more testin'  
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'  
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with  
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined  
And everybody 'round you is so basic  
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist  
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'  
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'  
And some dope dimes on some coke lines  
Gimme head all night, cum four times  
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound  
Do an ounce, get some dick  
Tell her friends about it

This year Imma focus on the vision  
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'  
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'  
Don't believe the rumours, bitch, I'm still a user  
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters  
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'  
Imma spend it all on bitches  
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'  
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'  
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute  
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission  
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz  
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens  
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through  
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual  
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral  
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems  
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon  
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke  
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless  
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans  
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix  
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices  
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices  
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices  
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless  
Yeah, that shit is pointless  
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?

The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets  
Whatever situation or the circumstances  
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances  
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn  
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin  
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess  
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress  
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping  
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains  
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead  
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride  
Strapped and ready to ride  
  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Inspectah Deck]  
Yeah, that's my down bitch  
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man  
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan  
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves  
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs  
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back  
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that  
Damn right, she the star of my team  
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene  
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens  
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen  
Playboy status, every man's lust  
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs  
  
[U-God]  
I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor  
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?  
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now  
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down  
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground  
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down  
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first  
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt  
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down  
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style  
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off  
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off  
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer  
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
You've learned how to kill  
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end  
Yet, we wish to preserve life  
The first thing to learn, is that difference  
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning

Wu-Tang Clan,Sunlight,"[Sample]  
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts  
the fists are the arrows, the body is the bow  
All movements have to be....  
  
[RZA]  
I'm the 7 in the center of the sun, I keep shinin  
My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds  
That be twinklin, while my love be sprinklin  
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin  
ALLAH's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious  
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless  
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases  
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces  
  
[Break]  
  
The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions  
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection  
Who gives you all and never ask more of you  
The faithful companion that fights every war with you  
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical  
He's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle  
A mission impossible, purely philosophical  
But you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital  
  
[Break]  
  
And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil  
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil  
Building a home for themselves and storing food  
At night we praise ALLAH and adore the moon  
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child  
Only fearin' GOD, we great a ghost with a smile  
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh  
Meaning life has no partnership with death  
  
[Break]  
  
Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us  
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce  
Mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings  
And eventually pledge their allegiance  
To that which was against them and exempt them from the truth  
Then juiced them and pimp them to givin them ties  
So the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies  
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  
Trying to harness the wind  
ALLAH's the father from without and within  
On Christ return, who will announce him?  
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?  
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?  
ALLAH is the father of all, why do you doubt him?  
  
[Sample]  
  
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts  
the fists are the arrow, the body is the bow  
All movements have to be mental  
The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful  
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance  
Avoid the enemy's strong points

Wu-Tang Clan,Tearz,"After laughter, comes tears  
  
Yo check yo yo, check the script  
Me and the gods get it ripped  
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip  
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast  
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed  
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss  
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)  
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far  
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!  
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead  
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread  
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer  
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner  
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""  
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""  
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag  
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.  
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block  
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)  
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet  
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete  
I picked him up, then I held him by his head  
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was  
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?  
It's always the good ones who have to die  
Memories in the corner of my mind  
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time  
I taught him, all about the bees and birds  
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words  
  
After laughter, comes tears  
  
Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter  
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma  
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck  
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect  
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed  
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give  
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next  
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex  
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real  
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal  
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do  
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you  
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt  
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you  
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory  
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story  
But he carried on, with the same old stuff  
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck  
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.  
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now  
No life to live, doc says two more years  
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears  
  
After laughter, comes tears  
After laughter, comes tears

The world is shifty, we livin' just enough for the city  
The rough witty killa bee sting just like the jiggy  
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone  
Label them my anus and the casualty's home  
It glows coffin, Wu stormin' like the light brigade  
ride the wave like Frankie Avalon  
As I decipher AIDS crime pays  
The law's long arm be tryin' to strongarm, walkin timebombs  
before I bomb firearm  
The chalm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster  
He toke with his own love and expose the black toaster  
Composer was shook  
I took your bad looks for joke get your back broke  
Deep throat this murder I wrote  
The antidote be seekin' like a buried treasure  
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector  
Wanted dead or alive

leavin' no footprints to trace  
Keep a war face, in your place

Plots to bump me off D.O.T. be on the hunt for me  
We stay hungry, for money drugs and guns  
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs  
Know the science be my Goddess  
The facts tell gats sell like sex and violence  
And break the project silence, a vision  
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison  
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world  
for the world war is ocean bomber  
Visionary soldier comma  
My code of honor, mind still start from the drama  
Trauma sent the victim, witness them run, scream in horror  
Military chopper come gun down the slum  
The outcome do or die Son it's bound to come  
Mentally aware I see truth within the square  
The future's here catch me on computer software  
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official  
It's a thirty-eight special, that steps through  
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle  
I may die in the scuffle but I'm takin' forty devils

[Raekwon]  
Snowy night, fiends basing  
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing  
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off  
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck  
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck  
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two  
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl  
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent  
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding  
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut  
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies  
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib  
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her  
Lester, smoked Chester sister, Vest, I heard it was a mess  
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her  
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trained us  
Who got reluct', think fast, and blast from Beamers  
  
[Ghostface Killah]  
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushing the cart  
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's  
That's what I get, not focusing, from hitting that bar  
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark  
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down  
  
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound  
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim  
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again  
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby  
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though  
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...  
You better kill me... you know you're booty...  
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!  
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it  
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing  
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him  
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him  
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles  
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows  
I had to show him what it's all about  
Next thing you read in the paper ""A man who came to kill, gets knocked out""  
  
[Chorus: Erykah Badu]  
I don't know whhhhhhhhhhhy... nobody told you  
Man's not supposed to cry...

Yo aiyo yo yo yo  
You on ya way to the store, nigga, grab me a Dutch  
I'm mad as fuck, my dude, my count was short when I was bagging it up  
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup  
What's up with Officer Brown? The other day he tried to shackle me up  
He killed Kase and now he hassling us  
This motherfucker got balls, even the gaul to try and patten me up

Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments  
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise  
Starlight scope, with the night vision device  
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice  
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice
